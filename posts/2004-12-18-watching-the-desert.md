| The sands of the desert are calm and quiet.
| A snake makes himself into a pen
| and draws the longest letter I have ever seen.
|
| The lizards push against the rocks
| up and down, up and down --
| inmates of Hell's own fitness spa.
|
| The gila monster is still where I last saw him.
| And above it all, the cactus, centuries old --
|   Old Man of the Desert --
| yet an infant of the sands and rock.
|
| And me, with my pen.
| What can I say?
| I am always thirsty.
