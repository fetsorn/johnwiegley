| A movie plays...
| Light painted on the wall
| Watching intently
| I find myself enthralled
| What will happen?
| What will they do?
| The drama unfolds
| Each moment new.
|
| Till the final hour
| When the lights go dark
| And all is blank again
| Not a single mark
| Everything at once
| Returns to blank space
| The characters, the pagentry
| Everything replaced.
|
| What remains is only...
| The effect on my heart
| The traces in my mind
| Decisions I now make differently
| ... I leave all the rest behind.
