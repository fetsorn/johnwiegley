| I know the feel of the midnight wind;
| I know the touch of another's soul.
| Both pass over, moving, changing
| and feeding the fire within.
|
| At once soft and profound,
| silent and symphonous --
| our wordless exchanges
| touch eye and brow and heart with meaning.
|
| Yesterday became what it should have been.
| And now, the present forming between us --
| I wonder if that late-night spent
| was not the future as it ought to be.
