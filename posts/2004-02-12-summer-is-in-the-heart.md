| lazily drifting on the breeze
| scents of summer, jasmine and orange
| the sun tinging all with gold
| beneath skies of spotted blue
| the music of leaves, of crickets
| of midnight frogs in the trees
| soft grass between my toes
| the cool touch of the lake
| and ringing tones of laughter...
|
| whatever season it may be
| summer is in the heart.
