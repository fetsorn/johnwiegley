| Seek truth where it may be found:
| No one asks if the sun is shining;
| no one ponders if the band still plays;
| no one questions the firmness of the ground.
|
| Plato's company shuffled from the cave,
| and found the fact of light is blinding.
| To a thirsty man, water is the proof;
| to the hungry, food is their book of Revelation.
|
| Not theories can warm the coldness of the night;
| brilliant thoughts won't compete with a single Ray.
| Ask the lover for this or that proof --
| he will bleed to show you the way.
