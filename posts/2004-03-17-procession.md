| In the palace of the sky,
| a great, blue carpet has been laid,
| bearing a procession of liveried, white ghosts
| toward a throne of gold,
| seating a king whose crown cannot be viewed.
|
| The guests tumble anxiously, slowly,
| rending their own fiber in their patient wait;
| bumping without hurry, they hurry;
| without substance, they present a picture
| constant through every year of time.
|
| Each morn the wan prince, donned in glory,
| rustles his silken sheets of pink.
| Gathering attendants far and wide
| though his kingdom last but for a wink!
|
| Yet: Do they look down at us, or up?
| Are we their sky, reflections from a mirror in-between?
| In which phantoms grasp at eternity
| and learn that forms subsist not,
|   only patterns,
|   only essences that repeat their manifestation
|     throughout the great, broad length of time.
