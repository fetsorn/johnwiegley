| When the foggy tides
| surge upon the land,
| filling in the spaces
| of the grey-bricked cities
| and the meadows of green,
| and the anodyne hills,
| pluming everywhere like smoke
| from a Great Father's pipe...
|
| Then it seems like
| a sea upon the sea,
| with buoys that flash red
| where the skyscrapers dreamed;
| and perhaps a poet or two
| watching from his fog beach
| musing at the millions
| who've become fish, unawares.
