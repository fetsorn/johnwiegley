| When the smell of rain
| is fuller than the rain itself...
|
| When one drops fall
| and then a thousand;
| when the first bolt
| divides the sky;
| when a clap resounds
| like the Hands of God;
| and the water on your lips
| fell from Heaven...
|
| After the fury and the darkness
| will shine every color
| that eyes can see.
