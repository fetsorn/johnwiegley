| The movements of a train
| over long rails
| of hardened purpose
| a pair of arrows
| forever flying sure
| the cold steel
| impervious to distraction.
|
| The movements of a train
| upon the iron rails
| without which
| the purpose of even
| the finest engine
| would remain unknown:
| a being without
| the will to move.
