| The sun rises and sets;
| it moves through the Zodiac;
| it shines on clear days
| or is hidden by clouds.
|
| Whatever condition
| the Earth happens to be in
| determines how we see
| the sun on that day.
|
| Meanwhile,
| it has never moved,
| never changed,
| never shined
| any more or less brightly.
