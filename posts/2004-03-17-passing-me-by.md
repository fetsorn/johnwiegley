title: Passing me by
tags: poetry
---

| I repose with sadness
| beneath a canopy of memories;
| and watch my life -- how it unfolded --
| wondering exactly who lived it?
|
| Not all the sentiments were mine;
| not all the thoughts would I agree with.
| As if a ghost had given me his memories,
| and left me to contemplate them for a while.
|
| What frightens me is that this ghost
| intends to continue using my body.
| But I shall not let it!  I shall awake!
| The life of unawareness is too small for us both.
