title: Ode to a salmon

| Flesh: pink, cold, oily:
| Covering rice: wet, shining and white;
|
| My tongue embraces what soon disappears,
| as a lover who comes and leaves in the night.
|
| Like a truth known only in doing:
| a temporary, unexplainable right;
|
| That fish I had still plays with me,
| and lingers on in memory's sight.
|
| Just a fish, you ask?  Don't play the fool;
| only a master, striving could cut it just quite.
|
| Ah, what my mouth wouldn't give to taste it again...
| another round of that ultimate bite.
