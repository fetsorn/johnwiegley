| Is the sound of sorrow
| limited, like a voice's cry?
|
| Or does the soul's suspiration
| heed no boundaries of space or time?
|
| The winds of late have seemed
| to hold a deeper tone;
|
| More than just the capping of waves
| along the rolling blue.
|
| Was that your soft weeping I heard?
| or were those salty drops the ocean's own...
