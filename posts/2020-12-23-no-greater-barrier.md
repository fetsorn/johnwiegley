| There is no greater barrier in our journey
| than the boundaries of self.
| It is a prison whose walls we cannot break,
| since our own desire strengthens them.
|
| We are the narrators of our existence,
| deeply believing in the stories we tell ourselves:
| a shadow world pulled over the eyes;
| a mirage of imagination.
