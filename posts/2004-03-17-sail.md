| Sails full, reaching out,
| leaving the world of people
| far enough behind to miss them.
|
| The landscape is ever the same,
| maintaining its similitude
| though I've gone a hundred miles since.
|
| The secrets she has to tell, this sea:
| a patient listener, far deeper than
| the querying blue eyes
| that wait for me back home.
