| He lays fallen upon the ground,
| victim to a battle
| more die for with every day;
| his worth spent,
| the fiber of his head
| clouded by moody pensations;
| a collar of white,
| crown of dusty gold
| crushed flat
| by the heel that cast him aside;
| and lacking now the breath
| that summoned his end
| to tell of his humble plight --
| he must ever remain unsung:
| a cigarette butt.
