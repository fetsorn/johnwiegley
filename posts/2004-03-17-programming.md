| Silently I peer into my computer,
| perceiving a palette of mental dreams.
| Images flash into my brain,
| then pour out in a stream of rapid fingers --
| no less real than the world around me.
|
| And my office is bereft,
| except for the little grey box, unassuming,
| where a whole other world takes place.
