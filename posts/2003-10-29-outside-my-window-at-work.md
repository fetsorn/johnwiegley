title: Outside my window at work

| I was awed by life.
|
| And here I sit,
| silent,
| lost in that awe.
|
| A tree with its leaves shining;
| the sky, a gradient blue;
| pure white clouds fading in the sun:
| a moment to appreciate.
|
| It may only be the view outside my window,
| but who painted it?
| thrilling my heart as any painter might --
|
| Striking awe into a being
| now silent.
