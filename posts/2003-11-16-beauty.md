| If I speak of sadness and sorrowful weeping,
| lachrymose wandering,
| clutching at my heart --
| perhaps I refer to the beauty of its reality.
|
| Or loneliness.  Although empty beyond thought,
| vacant like the winter, without warmth,
| a terrible disease of struggling --
| yet is it a real thing, an honest thing.
|
| Such purities burn away
| the heavy sackcloth
| that hides the face of beauty.
