| When before I’d wandered
| along the sea of the Unseen
| I’d make of myself a glass
| to catch every drop I was able…
| 
| Though after time’d passed
| I’d look at what I’d found
| And see: few attributes of
| the sea had endured:
| 
| No color; no depth or richness...
| Instead, I saw those parts
| that fit within me:
| wetness, fluidity,
| salt upon the tongue...
| 
| No one had told me
| that my true nature
| is more fish-like than man.
| All I need do is accord
| with my inmost desire
| and leave behind all
| that I claim as my own.
| 
| Then, from this place
| of quiet and abiding peace,
| I send you greetings
| and ask not to return.
