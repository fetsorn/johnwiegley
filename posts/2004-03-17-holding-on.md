| Sadness sits down with me for tea,
| and my cup fills up with tears.
|
| Emptiness grips me,
| and the content is gone.
|
| Loneliness holds me,
| and I cease to care.
|
| Depression finds me,
| and it all fades to uniform black...
|
| But somewhere, there is a spark.
| Otherwise I'd be already gone.
