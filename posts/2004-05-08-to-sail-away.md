| Globes of moonlight float along the water,
| fishes nibble at the morsels of light;
| I lean against the railing, hands pressed down,
| closing my eyes to remember the sight...
|
| Sail on, lonely barque, carry me far --
| Loose my spirit on the darkened seas!
| I'll hear no more of heaven and earth:
| only waves crashing and the constant breeze.
