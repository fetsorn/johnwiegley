| Should the moon settle on the waters
| appearing bright among the waves,
| and lead the mind to tranquil thoughts
| of earlier times, and younger days,
|
| Remind the heart: it's still free yet:
| there's nothing lost that's not been gained;
| it's simply how we look on things
| that sometimes feels restrained.
