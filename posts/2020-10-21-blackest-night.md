    O my dear, moth-like soul!
    He seeks an undiscovered Sun.
    He aims himself at skies
    Feeble wings have never flown.

    What can be done?
    Despondent and dejected
    He turns from the Infinite
    Ponders his privations
    Laments his limits
    Makes his plaint.

    And thus I turned myself
    To the deepest and darkest places.
    To a night so black
    It is an ink that stains my soul.

    Such that someday,
    As I fly, idly along,
    I may encounter but a single photon
    And ken the secrets of glory.
