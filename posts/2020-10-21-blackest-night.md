| O my dear, moth-like soul!
| He seeks an undiscovered Sun.
| He aims himself at skies
| feeble wings have never flown.
|
| What can be done?
| Despondent and dejected
| he turns from the Infinite
| ponders his privations
| laments his limits
| makes his plaint.
|
| And thus I turned myself
| to the deepest and darkest places.
| to a night so black
| it is an ink that stains my soul.
|
| Such that someday,
| as I fly, idly along,
| I may encounter but a single photon
| and ken the secrets of glory.
