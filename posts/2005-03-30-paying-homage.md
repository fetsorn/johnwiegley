| See how the wild daisy
| bows in the wind?
| But what does it make
| obeisance to?
|
| To you, looking on,
| it pays homage
| to nothing at all.
|
| So come closer --
| still closer --
| until you too
| feel the breath of Wind
| on your face.
|
| Only then can you know
| whether that flower
| is a wise one
| or a fool.
