| A mood of night
| settles on the trees,
| on the satin of dark waters,
| on the rocks and the creatures
| of the watery deep.
|
| The moon is a bold eye
| watching the land of evening;
| sewing by his regard
| tiny pearl-drops of light
| that tempt the oyster's envy.
|
| And in the far-off, apace:
| an isle of moonlight
| drifts beneath the silent glow,
| a carpet of lambent silver
| against the mood of night.
