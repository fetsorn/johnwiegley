| Looking up we saw a face,
| clear, bold and gazing at the sun.
|
| Its deep lines bespoke countless years;
| its running fall of tears, a joyful sadness.
|
| It was the face of a mountain,
| Now ten thousand years old,
|
| Capturing what all faces from the beginning of time have known:
| Wonder, awe and the patience of long years;
|
| Surprise, astonishment and the mute wonder we feel
| When we imagine how all of it came to be.
