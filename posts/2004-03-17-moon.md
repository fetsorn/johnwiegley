| The moon lives up there,
|   so far away,
|     so detached,
|       so disinterested.
|
| I imagine it has no connection with us,
| the living.
|
| And then I think:
|   there are so many poems written,
|     so many songs,
|       hearts inspired,
|         minds turned thoughtful...
|
| Looking from where I stand
| it seems so very far away;
| But reflecting more deeply:
| it is more involved with life than I am.
