| I have taken Pain into my arms
| for a final kiss --
| no longer shall it sting me.
|
| But then I wait;
| my lips grow dry --
| until the anguish of no anguish
| overcomes me,
| and my arms fly open once again.
|
| It is a pain so sweet
| we remember every bitter word!
| Burned into our memory
| with a flame of love --
| ambivalent, yet fierce in meaning.
|
| It is I, the pale shadow,
| who feels burnt by the sun;
| not I, the blazing glory,
| whose rays reach to infinity.
