| A calm wind rises up,
| carrying rose petals in a lazy spiral,
| touching you in places
| too intimate for words to picture.
|
| Are my thoughts that wind?
| and fond memories the roses
| that shed petals in long sighs
| of remembrance, adoration and longing?
|
| The image is frail glass, blown gossamer
| over a canvas of gentle nature;
| let no words intrude -- lest the silence break
| and shatter the peace in a weeping of broken glass.
