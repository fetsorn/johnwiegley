| The true mystic is a lion
| with the face of a kitten.
| Only his own kind know who he is.
|
| He speaks in the softest words --
| so soft, their name is "silence" --
| yet his tone resounds for days.
|
| He is a presence without presence:
| a stillness full of motion.
| While seated, he soars;
|   over water, he strides.
|
| Like an invisible wind
| you never see him, though
| he works to great effect.
|
| Eating little, relishing everything;
| he never argues, but always wins.
| His life is a happy contradiction.
|
| The people think he is nothing --
| a kind of innocent child --
| to which he whole-heartedly agrees...
|
| For it is this very nothingness
| that makes him great.
