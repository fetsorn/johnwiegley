| The sunlight is honey
| filtered through the sky
| dripping onto my skin
| like warm fingertips
| of a loving Hand;
| the wind whispers
| what its touch suggests;
| even the silence
| is speaking to me;
| "even in fire"
| are words like a summer's evening;
| the colors blue, green, yellow --
| banners of the garden,
| words of one voice of light --
| joining in the symphony
| of whispering, honeyed,
| silent, flaming colors;
| they unite in pronouncing
| *one word*
| whose utterance is the final hope of man:
|
| I have heard you, I said;
| "I wished to be known", He replied.
