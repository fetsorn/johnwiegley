| Spring has come
| stealing dew from the leaves
| to make flowers:
| a fecund dance
| of seed and soil and sun.
|
| The pregnant Earth,
| the watering sky;
| all the land giving birth:
| a hoarde of children
| who scream with their colors...
|
| The bees are dressed in banded aprons,
| gathering what can be gathered,
| making their honeyed draught.
| Love is in the air, this season.
| What will you make of it?
