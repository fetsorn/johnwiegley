| And now I stand before the sea
| of my ever-fluxing possibilities.
| As I step forward, they do not drown me;
| there is no water in my lungs,
| no gasping or struggling --
| no reason to return to the shore.
|
| With each stride, the walls of resistance
| rise up to my left and my right,
| and my feet know only the hard ground,
| the sure path,
| that can no longer be obscured.
