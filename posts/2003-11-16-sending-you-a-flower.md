title: Sending you a flower

| I meant to send you a rose today;
| but the distance was too great.
|
| But not for words.
|
| And I began to wonder:
|   how many letters before I match
|   the softness of a petal's touch?
|   How many thoughts, mulled together,
|   can conjure up the image
|   of lilies, waving in the spring?
|
| I know your heart is fertile,
| and its soil ready for the seed...
| Would not a single, quiet glance,
| suffice to set the rendezvous?
|
| Then here it is:
|   be mine.
| I think the silence says the rest.
