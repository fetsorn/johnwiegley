title: Self is the boundless vacuum

    The seeker's true enemy is finding
    for the event dispels his being.
    Neither does a moth collect embers
    nor any shadow become an expert on daylight.

    Self is incompatible with love,
    who abhors the line between “you” and “I”.
    In the end, love itself is a mighty veil,
    because what is yearning without separation?

    The longing of a broken thing to be made whole;
    the discordance of a melody missing its final note.
    Self is the boundless vacuum that dare not breathe
    though its marrow be a plaint for reunion.
