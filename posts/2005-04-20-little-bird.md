| I think perhaps
| your heart is a little bird,
| longing to beat its wings
| in the high places,
| to sing and sing
| until Song itself says, "Enough!"
|
| I sit near you
| and hear the flapping
| of those tiny wings...
| Your body seems to float away.
| If you ran with all your might
| you couldn't catch up
| with that eager heart.
|
| You are a creature of spirit
| living here for a short while;
| don't ever imagine
| the bars on your cage
| are a part of who you are.
|
| Fly on, little bird:
| fly on -- until flight becomes you.
