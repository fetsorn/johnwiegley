| The wind whispers secrets
| ears cannot hear,
| its magics unknown to a
| "heart possessed by fear".
|
| Gird up your faith!
| Walk on those waves!
| Find the hidden Gem
| that hides before your eyes...
|
| For the moment is precious
| and the days are short;
| soon, this grand movie
| will play to its end.
|
| So listen again --
| listen a thousand times! --
| to that coy, coquettish wind...
| and when you hear its answer:
| Ascend.
