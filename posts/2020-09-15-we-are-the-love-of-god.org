title: We are the love of God

    No concept, idea or intimation of God
    will ever even be close.
    But the thirsty man
    is already joined to the river;
    the flower embraces the sun;
    the seed in the dirt struggles
    toward the unseen sky.
    We /are/ the love of God,
    if only the self be put aside.
