| Prayer magnetizes the needle of the heart;
| and since He is closer to us
| than our life’s vein,
| no movement is needed,
| merely direction
| and sanctity of heart.
|
| I think the length of our prayer
| should relate to our need for
| this refining and alignment.
|
| I don’t think God desires
| a mercantile relationship with us,
| where count and length
| are measures of spiritual value.
