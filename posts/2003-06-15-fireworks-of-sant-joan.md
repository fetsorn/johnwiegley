| At one moment, it is too quiet.
| Expectation remakes the stillness
| into a sharp knife
| cutting away at the future...
|
| Then a tiny puff of sound,
| the tension climbing in pace
| with some unseen shape
| that waiting eyes see too well...
|
| Then too fierce for the one moment!
| whose gentle, pausing silence
| is ripped into a flash of color
| as a wound from some bright being
| hiding in the blackened clouds
| until...
| that one moment of sound and flash.
|
| And now the embers of a heavenly fire
| drift slowly back to earth.
