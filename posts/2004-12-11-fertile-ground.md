| My life was a fertile ground
| but bare.
| So I prayed for what was needed --
| the fruits and the flowers --
| and every prayer I made
| planted a seed.
|
| What I could not know
| is how each plant must grow:
| some put out thorns
| before blossoms;
| some are only gnarled wood
| until the first fruit appears.
|
| Now I look around
| at the crazy jungle of my life
| thinking each leaf,
| each thorny branch,
| is a part of something more.
