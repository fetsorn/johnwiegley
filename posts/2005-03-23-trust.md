| Once, in another world,
| I was sitting with the Shaykh of my spirit,
| a great Master.
|
| Next to us
| a huge fire was roaring,
| consuming all my books,
| my belongings, even my clothes.
|
| Then my Master said,
| "Now cast yourself into the flames."
| And so I jumped,
| without a moment's hesitation.
|
| To my great surprise, I was unburnt.
| The flames were cold to the touch
| although everything around me
| was being destroyed.
|
| I turned to my Master.
| He was shaking his head.
| "Alas, in the end you have failed me, my pupil."
|
| "How did I not obey?" I asked.
|
| He said, "Your failure was this:
| Despite your claims of complete faith in me,
| you expected to be burned."
