| Ahead of me faced a long hall
| seemingly dedicated to blackness.
| From either side, through closed doors,
| I heard screams and tired sighs;
| moans that betrayed an impatient anguish
| and a longing for an end to life.
|
| Nearby, someone tapped me on the shoulder,
| causing me to look up from my newspaper.
