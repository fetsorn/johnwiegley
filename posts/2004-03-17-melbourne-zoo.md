| Giraffe: tall, long-headed -- a tongue of 40cm
| Sloping back, checkered spots;
| he slips away to nibble on some palm leaves.
|
| Kangaroo hopping up, biting the finger of a youngster
| whose Mom finds it amusing!
| A beautiful coat of orange-brown,
| very interested in people.
|
| Wombat: squat, fat, slow.  Burrowing.
| A burrowed mound for a home.
| Not moving an inch: a lazy gopher the size of a watermelon.
