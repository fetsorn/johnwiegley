title: The sun and not the sun
tags: poetry

| Imagine all your life
| you were blinded
| and kept in a room.
|
| Suddenly the cloak
| is pulled off your head
| and there you sit,
| in front of a perfect mirror
| slanted toward you.
|
| Through a hole in the ceiling.
| the sun shines down
| onto the mirror
| and directly into your eyes.
|
| You hear someone say:
|   This is the sun.
|   This is not the sun.
|   It is both the sun and not the sun.
|   It is neither "the sun" nor "not the sun".
|
| What are they trying to say?
