| I feel your peace on quiet nights
| when the cool winds presage rain.
|
| Later your joy rises, with its gentle warmth
| to dry the dewdrops weighing the leaves.
|
| Your beauty sings like songbirds on branches
| or crickets pleading with the star-filled night.
|
| Your bright qualities are indeed my Charon:
| for their sublime touch ferries me to other worlds.
