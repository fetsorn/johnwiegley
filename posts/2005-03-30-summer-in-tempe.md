| What a fierce sun stares at me today.
|
| The roads shimmer in the air;
| the lizards alone enjoy it.
|
| Through my tinted lenses
| I watch the girls go by...
|
| Everyone talks of Fall
| as if Spring had never been.
|
| The cup of water in my hand
| is already warm!
|
| Summer, in Tempe, Ariona.
