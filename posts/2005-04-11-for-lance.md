| Sunlight
| where do you go?
| I know that at dusk
| you make the mountains glow.
| Your last ray catches my eye
| but I wonder:
| why must you go?
| Why leave me to the dark of night?
| To the cold,
| to the bitter hours...
| The moon's a poor reflection;
| the stars, a distant company.
| Is my only hope to wait?
| To trust we'll meet again?
| My dear sunlight
| where did you go?
