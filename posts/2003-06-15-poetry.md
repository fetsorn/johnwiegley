| Poetry is what a man writes
| when he is thrilled
| by the beauty of his own thought.
| Some in music, others in diagrams
| or programs, drawings, schematics...
|
| In whatever form
| it is a worship of the glory of knowing
| and of feeling
| and of reaching upward
| to capture a ray from heaven's beauty.
|
| Then it can be seen
| that God's greatest gift to man
| is his intellect.
| And man's greatest gift to God --
| and to himself --
| is to use it.
