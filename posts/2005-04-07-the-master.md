| When the Master appears
| is a time
| for questions and answers:
|   Your questions,
|   His answers.
|
| Do not presume
| to know in His presence;
| do not even imagine
| you know what Knowledge is.
|
| Bow to your Sensei!!
|
| If he says you're hungry,
| feel your stomach growl;
| let His words
| become your reality.
|
| As long as you consider Him
| with your eyes
| you see a feeble man;
|
| As long as He looks at you
| with His
| He gives His counsel.
