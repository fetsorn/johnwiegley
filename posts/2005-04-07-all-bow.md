| The poets strung pearls
|   so I undid the strands;
| the wise crafted words
|   so I helped them understand.
|
| The sophists debated
|   so I tied up their tongues;
| the prophets prophesied
|   so I gave Destiny a hand.
|
| When all was done
|   and the smoke had cleared
| each one bowed down before me:
|   "How swift thy sword!" they exclaimed.
|
| But I, the poet madman,
| did demure:
|   "It was Love that smote thee, sires,
|   for none may play the lord
|   in His domain."
