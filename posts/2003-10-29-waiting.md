| Waiting for the tips of trees
| to bow at your arrival...
| waiting.
|
| Waiting for the sun's light
| to reflect your longing gaze...
| waiting.
|
| Waiting for the phone to ring --
| a letter, a foot-fall...
| waiting.
|
| Waiting in a depth of silence
| that drowns my expectations...
| waiting.
|
| Waiting for the moon to shine,
| but not so bright
| as that face near mine...
| waiting.
|
| Waiting for you, if you haven't understood --
| waiting for you.
