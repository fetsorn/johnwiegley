| Without the light
| it would not be seen;
| without eyes
| it would not be seen.
|
| Between these two forms of nothing
| a being of phenomenon
| neither in the object
| or the eye or the light.
|
| But there... a subtle shading of rose
| shaped into a smile
| beneath eyes
| like my own hope given form.
|
| There... what is that shaft
| pushing its way into the labors of my heart?
| ruining the moment's peace
| and offering something
| I would live without peace for
| day upon day again.
|
| Between two different kinds of void:
| a thing to die for.
