"In a drop thou beholdest the secrets of the sea"
| so with all the perfections potential in thee.
|
| As a teacher draws forth from the days of youth
| our thoughts and ideas on the subject of truth,
|
| the mind develops, and the hearts unfold --
| bearing diamonds and rubies, emeralds and gold --
|
| from that inner land, hidden in the eyes of a babe,
| every great man and woman is made.
