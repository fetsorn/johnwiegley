| Ask the lover for a drop of wisdom
| and he will cry out tears unearthly wise;
|
| He will tell you happiness is impossible --
| that his life is not his to live...
|
| For when She tosses her flowing hair
| oceans crash on sandy shores
| and he is flung on rocks again and again.
|
| Her eyelashes move in a simple motion
| covering and revealing whole worlds to his view --
| yet remain forbidden to explore.
|
| Her voice cannot be pictured here;
| such blasphemy is not allowed.
|
| The lover's silence is his deepest testimony.
| His crying agony, the wails of pain,
| the moaning that denies all existence --
| can be heard so clearly
| from his heart that speaks no sound.
