| The warm summer nights have now betrayed me,
| turned cold, winter winds that ice the bone,
| beneath a moonless sky of shadow, velvet.
|
| Yet through the dotted black, watching for the sun to rise,
| hands pressed tight to fend the zephyr's howl,
| I remember what the solstice brings, besides just cold and sorrow:
|
| It signals the eternal promise,
| that whatever was far will come near again,
| to return, just as surely, though slowly, as before.
