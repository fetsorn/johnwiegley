| Happiness is a flowing warmth that
|   binds us, heart to heart;
| and the wings that I'd forgotten
|   you've unfolded and made strong.
|
| Up, to heights where even eagles
|   cannot dare to soar,
| I fly now, carried on a breeze
|   of memories that shall never fade.
|
| Always, angel of my heart, always
|   is the promise that I make.
| Let time watch us fade into mortal dust
|   while ever my heart is soaring.
