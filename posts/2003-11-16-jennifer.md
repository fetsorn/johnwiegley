| That night, when my head was back,
| counting stars in the awesome blackness of the sky,
|
| I remember you wondered at my strangeness --
| why I waited so long to leave.
|
| Perhaps love isn't a thing common
|   to a child's heart,
| but what I knew then, I still know now:
|
| The rest is up to you.
