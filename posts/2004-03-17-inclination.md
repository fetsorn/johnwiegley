| Poetry, music, or art
| is something we use to equate
| ourselves with a greater beauty outside.
|
| In the falling leaves of autumn,
| or the raindrops that lie with sadness on the ground,
|
| We behold something in nature --
| isolated for a single moment by our attention --
| that draws out from our hearts
| an impulse toward something greater.
