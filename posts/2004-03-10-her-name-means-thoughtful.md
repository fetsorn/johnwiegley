| How much do we ponder
| the effect we have on each other's lives --
| even if it goes no further than a single day,
| no deeper than a conversation?
|
| Sometimes, our eyes as we walk away,
| or a simple touch,
| or laughter,
| can mean everything to a person's heart.
|
| What we don't see
| is how life prepares us
| to understand this.
