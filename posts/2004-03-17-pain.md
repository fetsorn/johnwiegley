| Man clutches at his heart with an empty fist --
|   finding nothing to remove, nothing to replace --
| while the pain of it burns him like a dying ember,
|   trapped and immovable in the center of his chest.
|
| In the hope of love, he lives on --
|   hope of peace, hope of rest, hope of stillness.
| He hopes until wet tears bring the taste of salt to his mouth;
|   and yet still, there is nothing but that salt to console him.
|
| Farewell, to the fading sunset:
|   not in this life will I find relief,
| but in the next, where all things wonderful that could not be
|   find expression in ways we never dreamed of.
