| At dawn she reclined in thought,
| considering the tapestries of Earth,
| finding meaning in the destinies of earth-worms.
|
| Then morning came.
|
| With plant-slowness, her arms unfolded,
| and she lifted her leaves to the sun.
|
| What in the night
| had been a goddess of melancholy,
| reveals colors now
| sadness has never known.
