| Ideas should be like clouds:
| there one day, gone the next,
| always returning.
| Causing us to wonder,
| to find intriguing shapes
| soon burnt away by the sun.
| No matter how many we see,
| each one is different.
| Some provide a moment's shade,
| others rain the bounties of heaven.
| They connect without seams --
| innumerable, yet one in substance.
| Never impeding flight,
| sometimes touching the earth,
| obscuring, yet informative.
| And when their time is up,
| they are gone.
