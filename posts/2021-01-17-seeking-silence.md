title: Seeking silence

| If you ask questions to find silence,
|   you've failed.
| If you say anything at all,
|   this is not helpful.
| What you seek is exactly as far from you
|   as your seeking.
| When you've abandoned all words, that.

And a favorite verse by Rumi:

| This silence, this moment, every moment,
| if it's genuinely inside you,
| brings what you need.
| There's nothing to believe.
|
| Only when I stopped believing in myself
|   did I come into this beauty.
| Sit quietly, and listen for a voice
| that will say, 'Be more silent.'
|
| Die and be quiet.
|
| Quietness is the surest sign that you've died.
| Your old life was a frantic running from silence.
|
| Move outside the tangle of fear-thinking.
