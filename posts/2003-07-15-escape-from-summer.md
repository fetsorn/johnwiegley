| Trees are aflame in a fire without heat.
| Golden reds and crimson yellows climb through the branches.
|
| A kiss of temperate winds on the cheek.
| A feel of soft grasses, and sounds muffled by leaves.
|
| The heat of summer days giving way.
| Cool nights of bullfrogs and cricket songs.
|
| The moon, a shade of water's blue.
| The starlight neither hazy, nor winter bright.
