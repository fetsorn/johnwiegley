| If I speak to you of the sea,
| feel it rolling through your heart,
| carrying you to lands unknown
| beyond the cloudy ridge of mystery.
|
| She changes shape, temper,
| strength and rhythm,
| even as we speak of her --
| because we speak of her --
| one whose waters feed on our dreams.
|
| Last night I lay with the sea,
| her arms enfolding me a thousand times.
