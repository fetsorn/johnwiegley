| The Revelation of God is like a curtain
| made to be pulled back
| to reveal a Loved One
| you have longed for all your life
| even if you never knew her name.
|
| It exists because
| it is not meet and seemly
| that such pure beauty
| should be revealed to all eyes
| avaricious and vulgar.
| The heart must be tested, and shown true.
|
| As a veil, it should be seen as a veil.
| That is, look for the point of turning
| behind each word
| how it leads back and connects to Him.
| It reveals what it conceals.
