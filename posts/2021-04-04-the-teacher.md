title: The teacher

| The teacher must first
| teach himself:
| more than words,
| the bones of it.
|
| Like Plato's
| men in the cave:
| if one fire-watcher
| tells another fire-watcher
| of the sun --
| this is pure fantasy;
|
| But a philosopher
| who walks back from above,
| who has still sunlight on his breath:
| he exhales light;
| his words glow with truth discovered;
| he is a beacon in the darkness
| and no mere creature of it.
|
| Let the teacher first become
| a thirst for knowing.
