| Leave me alone --
| to walk through the streets
|   unhurried, unhindered,
| placing each foot deliberately;
| feeling the weight of my body
| as it rocks back and forth.

| Kids thirst to get through school
|   and find a job.
| What a useless waste!
| if one doesn't understand why he does it.
|
| The world doesn't encourage
| time off to think about these things.
| They'd prefer to notice the parachute
| ten thousand feet from the valley floor
| and falling...
