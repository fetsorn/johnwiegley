| Fear not, little seed.
|
| The Farmer has destined
| all good things for you:
| A warm sun,
| furry friends,
| a refreshing breeze.
|
| With what wisdom!
| He thrust you in a hole,
| pitch and dark;
| airless, lightless;
| every movement a struggle.
| A world in every way opposite.
|
| Never cease reaching
| toward the sky you were promised.
| Fear not, little seed,
| Fear not.
