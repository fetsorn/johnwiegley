title: A candle's flame

| The darker the evening, the warmer its light --
|   a candle's flame.
| It whispers to the eyes,
| conjures the heart's nostalgia,
| breathes smoke like a child dragon:
|   a candle's flame.
|
| When the orchid candle weeps beside you,
| and its tears of purple rain a stinging, hot sweetness,
| you will then see the shape of my heart's longing:
|
|   Forlorn, desperate in a wilderness of absence,
|   weeping its waxen tears
|   and longing to find the way home.
|
| Come, lead me home,
| to where that eager light is shining even now.
