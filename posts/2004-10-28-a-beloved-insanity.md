| Love is a beloved insanity.
| If tongues could speak the tale
| of love's madness,
| no hearers would remain.
|
| They would, as one breath,
| ascend ash-like upon the breeze
| offering their hearts to the pyre --
| and not a one complain.
|
| For when it touched my own lips,
| it ruined my heart's kingdom.
| Peace became a travesty:
| my very hope was my despair.
|
| Where banners once flew in proud disdain
| a king now weeps for his kingdom's bane.
