| What human worker bee,
| humming within the drone
| the machine drone
| of corporate America,
| doesn't long for the
| giddy taste of Friday?
|
| In fact, the week is lost
| dreaming for that day.
| Monday pulls away
| from its heavy glue --
| slowly, drearily --
| while Thursday rushes forth,
| and daydreams leap ahead,
| jumping at the chance
| to play on Friday.
|
| In fact, we live
| in hope of Friday,
| in loss of Friday,
| wasting our lives
| every day but Friday.
|
| And on Friday?
| Generally we look to forget it:
| beer, wine, whatever.
| So I guess, ultimately,
| at birth we're already dead.
