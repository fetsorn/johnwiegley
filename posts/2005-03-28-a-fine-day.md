| The sun is warm today;
| the breezes are cool.
| Soft clouds embrace the light
| and acquire a radiant glow...
|
| The afternoon passes slowly.
| Children are playing on the grass.
| It's been hours since I last wondered
|   what time it was --
| hours since I thought, instead of lived...
|
| I wonder: Will You come join me
| here on the green grasses?
| Then I recall the sun,
| the breeze, the clouds, the day...
|
| When have You ever not been with me?
