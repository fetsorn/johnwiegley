title: Being too hard on yourself

| Being too hard on yourself
|   is ego too:
| measuring yourself harshly
| against a standard derived
| from your own understanding.
| 
| The path forward
| is a free and humble heart,
| continuously learning
| and turning toward God and joy.
| 
| "Ego" arises from ideas
| that ossify into a false sense of reality —
| whether within or without —
| and become veils between us
| and the Loved One.
