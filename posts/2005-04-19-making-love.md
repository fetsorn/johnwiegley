| I'm sitting here
| at this proper dinner party.
| But I can't help noticing
| the fit of the chair beneath me;
| how the breeze from outside
| brushes against my skin...
|
| The chocolate on my fork
| is a kiss on the lips,
| and the sweet music
| woos me with its song...
|
| How funny, that despite
| all these people around me --
| You still find ways of making love.
