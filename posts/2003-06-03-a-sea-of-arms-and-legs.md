| They spill like a sea,
| all walking, tan and colored drops,
| into the greater, deeper sea...
|
| One blue, above, endless from east to west
| but for its radiant Jewel;
| the other, blue, lapping at the sand,
| receiving great hordes --
| this clash of seas, splashing, playing...
|
| And the boats wander by --
| the arms, the legs! --
| and wander by again.
