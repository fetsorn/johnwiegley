| The deer in the park
| watch me with curiosity.
| What mysteries of life have I found?
| Do I know the way
| to the ever-green grass?
|
| With the breeze, they fade away --
| only daydreams --
| and I look to memory:
|
| Home in Virginia, the summer fields,
| winter meadows,
| spring brooks...
|
| Enough years I've lived
| to know them all many times.
|
| But the ever-green grass
| I have yet to find.
| Only in daydreams,
| seeming a little greener each year.
