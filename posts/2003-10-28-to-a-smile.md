| Have you ever known a smile to catch fire?
| to smolder in the kindling of a man's heart
| to provoke daring tongues of flame
| and by puffs of darkling smoke
| betray the heat that gathers
| of a moment's quiet admiration?
|
| I should call your mouth an oyster
| for all the pearls it reveals;
| and your beaming face: some far-off star,
| that sailors, in their wandering night
| might set sail for
| and guide their journey home.
|
| And your smile is so much like the dawn
| that on the horizon of your lovely face
| summons all the bright glories of day.
