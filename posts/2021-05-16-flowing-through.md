title: Flowing through

| Looking at the self,
| which at first appears
| to be a constant entity
| moving through time,
| we discover it's more
| of a standing wave form:
| no “self” that persists --
| only actualized by water
| ever flowing through.
| What is there to “be” enlightened?
| Nor does the Ocean ever cease
| its surge and flow.
