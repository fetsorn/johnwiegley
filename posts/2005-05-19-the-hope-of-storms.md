| I have heard the sea
| pour out its mournful lament;
| and the dirge of the clouds
| with their rumbles and lightnings.
|
| I have watched the grey sky
| enfold us in a shroud of sorrow;
| as the pall-bearer drops
| loose their lugubrious weight.
|
| These storms that feel
| like unending death:
| yet they kiss the ground
| with bright green hope.
