| I wish I had a switch
| that would make English
| a foreign language to me.
|
| Then I could watch the faces of people,
| bobbing up and down,
| and listen to the music of their voices:
|
| The soft tones, mixed with
| rich, lustry cooing;
| or the staccato whisper of a hushed conversation.
|
| And everything else:
| the complaints, rumors, gossip,
| and talk of this world;
|
| would transform again into something innocent
| and quite uniquely beautiful.
