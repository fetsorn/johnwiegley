| My sadness falls in sweetened drops
| for thought of you provokes them;
|
| If not these tears, I had not known,
| what form of love evokes them;
|
| My heart is stilled, its fires gone --
| it waits your Hand to stoke them...
|
| Now listen close and hear my pains:
| I'd no such joy, till you awoke them.
