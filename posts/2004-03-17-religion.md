| Religion
| teaches brotherhood, but divides men;
| proclaims love, but breeds hatred;
| calls for peace, but engenders war;
| applauds charity, but hoards like a scrooge;
| talks spirituality, but practices greed.
|
| Then, obviously,
| we are not talking about religion.
|
| Religion is a delicate flower
| man has crushed by his ignorance.
| Now we look at that dead, brown relic,
| and assume we know what it meant.
|
| Yet... flowers always bloom again.
