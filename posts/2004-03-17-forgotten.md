| The paper was pure white,
| and then I scribbled over it.
| Was it worthwhile?
| Was my impact on life sufficient?
|
| I think my death should be simple, invisible,
| and my tombstone free of words --
| so that only my actions remain.
|
| The thought that troubles me is this:
| will such special ink
| be strong enough to preserve my memory?
