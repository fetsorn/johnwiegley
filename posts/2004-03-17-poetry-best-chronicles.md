| Poetry best chronicles the devastation of the heart.
|
| Whether lost love,
| or mystical transcendence,
| or abasing fear.
|
| Whatever eradicates the man, and leaves the lover only:
| alone, wondering, debating the validity of his feelings against
|   a universe of other concerns.
|
| Only when we truly feel the triviality of our experience,
| does it somehow become genuine.
