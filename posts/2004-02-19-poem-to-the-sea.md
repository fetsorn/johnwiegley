| I watch you, my friend,
| your vast belly
| undulating in rhythms
| to some mystic dance;
| your gentle suspirations
| and balming murmurs
| that leave the heart entranced;
| your cold and watery hues:
| now green in the shallows
| now black in the depths --
| where uncounted fathoms
| halt the light's advance:
| I call you the sea --
| but every moment you change.
| You defy my conceptions.
| You swallow whole
| my ships of fancy --
| as you wash away the words
| I write upon your sands.
