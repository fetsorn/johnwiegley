title: A sun's love

---

| The sun's heart burns like fire cannot burn.
| Crossing the sky, it kneels to kiss the earth --
| and is swallowed by a wine-dark sea.
|
| We see everywhere the reason for the sun:
| It is life, light, time.
| But to it, are we larger than a pebble,
| circumambulating the mountain like a homesick flea?
|
| The sun's heart burns without purpose.
| It loves only to know love;
| showering the emptiness of space, unbounded,
| always giving, never conscious of return.
|
| Today, two white orbs, dotted with green
| reflect a light that can never be contained;
| swept a million miles into dream
| by a Heart more ardent than flame.
|
| Even as a sun's love finally
| created the hearts who adore it:
|
|   Love only to love,
|   and the Beloved will appear.
