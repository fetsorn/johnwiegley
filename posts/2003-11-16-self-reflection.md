| In the branches
| where the wind blows
| and daylight fights the shadows
| I found you.
|
| Your head tilted back
| admiring the clouds
| in deep repose of thinking;
| I wondered,
|
| What thought-strewn sea
| surges up?
| What white-clead breakers
| bear down
| and crash upon that brow?
|
| Such storms within
| to counterpoint
| the tranquil skies above.
