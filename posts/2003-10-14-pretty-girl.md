| I see you wearing ringlets, in a pretty dress;
| your skirt is more the shape than the cloth.
| And your tiny blouse expertly contains
| what my longing wishes free...
|
| You are beautiful, my dear -- let none say otherwise.
| I write you poems, but it's not enough;
| I would rather feel your curves
| than this smooth, white paper under my fingers.
