| All I would need is to hang like a fish
| on the shining hook of that moment,
| yanked about whichever way the Fishmonger wished
| stripped of my armory scales
| robbed of my heart, my lungs
| stretched over the burning flames
| and roasted into a pale memory --
| a moment's taste upon His lips.
|
| Thus am I reunited:
| I have found the way to mingle flesh.
| It requires only the mystery of that moment...
|
| Yet how quickly they would lead me away;
| how quickly they would counsel me never to look again.
|
| I suppose it makes a bad worker
| who has such a view of the sky in front of him
| into which the wings of his soul
| long to escape their frustrated peace.
