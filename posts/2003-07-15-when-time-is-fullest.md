| When time is fullest
| it loses all meaning.
| The hours go by in a moment
| and every minute
| is remembered as an hour.
| It passes faster than notice,
| and endures longer than possible.
|
| Only when time is regular
| every hour counting for an hour --
| ourselves fully conscious of each --
| does it bear any relation
| to the passing of our lives.
