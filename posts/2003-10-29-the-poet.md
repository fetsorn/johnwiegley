| A poet never knows which way
|   his pen will go, his mind will go;
| the canvas of the soul
| heeds his worded strokes --
| but the image remains unseen.
|
| Just as we speak from feeling,
| making full sentences
|   not knowing them beforehand,
|
| there is a vastness, unfilled,
| begging for that single drop...
| whose echoes
| are the shape of my words on paper.
