| Behold!
| I am the Moth Satan
| wreathed in flame.
|
| I glow with a heat
| only lovers
| can comprehend.
|
| My scepter
| is my burning limbs;
| my crown,
| my blazing brow;
| my throne,
| the torment
| that surrounds me...
|
| Behold!
| I am the Moth Angel --
| for fire and love
| have made me king.
