title: The farmer and the miller

| The shell of the seed is hard, so hard!
| and there is nothing for it
| but to be thrust into damp and dark
| and given patience, water, fertilizer and time.
|
| I think we are all beautiful souls,
| potential within the shell of self and limitation.
| Some will germinate;
| some fall on stony soil and need relocation.
|
| Yet how the farmer regards the seed
| is different from the miller.
| One sees the merit of todayâ€™s reality;
| the other ten or a hundred years further on.
