| I seek someone, but who is she?
| Or rather, who is She?
|
| In the faces that go by, not a one --
| only inklings.
|
| Then other times,
| when my heart and my eyes are clear,
| I stop, to dream unholy dreams.
|
| And in such a dream
| my lover speaks to me:
| she makes the wind to be her voice.
|
| Her eyes, like stars in the night sky,
| her hair a black moonlight
| that brushes my cheeks.
|
| For she is that sky,
| that pale and somber moon.
| I call out to her in yearning pleas
| and through my open door she comes.
