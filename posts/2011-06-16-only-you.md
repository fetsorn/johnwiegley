| There are times when I come to You in prayer,
| and feel like a beggar, hoping for salvation.
| Other days, I am a merchant, bargaining for my soul.
|
| I have been a philosopher, musing on death;
| and a coward, praying for more life.
|
| Each time I bow my head,
| I wear a different costume,
| and a different name to my profession.
|
| But today, I long to feel none of these.
| I wish only to come to You in prayer,
| and find no one else in attendance.
