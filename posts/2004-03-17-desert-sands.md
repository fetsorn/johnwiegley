| Adrift... so terribly adrift.
| Ever blown and reconfigured:
| never the same.
|
| As white as the pallor of death;
| dry, unfeeling,
| moving about with a purpose all their own.
|
| So much activity,
| so little result.
| Moving here and there, only to move back;
| today a valley, tomorrow a dune.
|
| Their vastness draws out from me all that I have
| and replaces nothing.
| Not even the sign that my efforts are worthwhile.
|
| And now they bury me,
| these desert sands,
| since I have become just as lifeless as they.
