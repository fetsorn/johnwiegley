title: The space between souls

| A flower reaches to the sun:
| it never touches, but achieves.
|
| The wind listens as we listen back;
| the sea understands, the stars speak.
|
|   Take away arms, I love you;
|   take away legs, I love you;
|   take away eyes, I love you;
|   no more body,
|   no more name,
|   no more "you":
|   I love you.
|
| You stand before my eyes
| ten thousand feet away
| and all I see
| is that lover inside me.
|
| How can we be separate from ourselves?
| Run!  Escape the perfection of God!
| As I watch, to behold the impossible.
