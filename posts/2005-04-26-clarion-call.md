| I shall cast upon the mountains --
|   as a clarion call! --
| the name of my Beloved;
| and commit to paper
| such tales of loving mention,
| all will be astonished.
|
| Whatever names you knew of Love
| before this -- forget them!
|
| The beating of every lover's heart
| will be the sound of my communion.
