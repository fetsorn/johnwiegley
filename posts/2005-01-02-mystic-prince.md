| The moth is a mystic prince:
| one who seeks the light
| because he can live no other way.
|
| The moon beckons him
| across vast, impossible distances --
| yet on he flies
| never thinking of his headway.
|
| If he reach a fire
| and have nothing for the altar,
| he places himself upon the stone
| and becomes what he admires.
|
| Only the moth knows
| that love is not enough.
| His search will never cease until he blazes
| with the same light that he seeks.
