| Your love is so very hard, my friend --
| and so very dear.
|
| Icicles that rain on my heart
| offer a cool draught
| once the sun of knowing rises;
|
| Bitter grains of salt
| make finely piquant
| the dishes life sends after;
|
| Harsh fire -- a great inferno --
| transfigures my iron soul
| into radiant shafts of light...
|
| So very hard, my friend,
| yet so dear.
