title: The life we live
tags: poetry

| The deepest part of my being
| I have never shared with anyone;
| so that between me and the world
| there is a fiction -- called "self" --
| which interacts according to our
| puerile desires of security and pleasantry.
|
| For they would have me believe
| that my spirit is either non-existent,
| or too fragile,
| to withstand the burden of such a revelation.
|
| To hell with them.
|
| What kind of life are they living?
