| In Heaven
| thirst is prized:
| it reveals the flavor of water;
| drinking is prized:
| it unites one with the Source;
| and the Ocean is life
| the Object of all desire.
|
| But in Hell
| thirst is torment:
| it reveals what is lacking;
| drinking is despised:
| it cannot satisfy;
| and the Ocean is death
| to the burning flame of desire.
