| Ah, true, sleepless one,
| I will ever write;
| it is only a question,
| should ears hear?
| or the river Tigris
| swallow the black tears
| that runs in drops of ink
| along these pages...
|
| Perhaps I feel echoes
| of that joy Bahá'u'lláh
| had known
| writing for His heart's Revelation
| but knowing none could hear.
|
| I possess no capacities as such
| yet every being
| is a symbol created
| by the accents of His voice.
