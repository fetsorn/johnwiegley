| Little Gila monster!
| Reaching over those pebbles must be hard.
| Your back, yellow like a hundred bees at rest,
| twists left and right, left and right,
| gathering strength to conquer those pebbles once again.
|
| Without haste you waddle home,
| a foot here, a foot there,
| until the desert stones alone
| remember your passage.
