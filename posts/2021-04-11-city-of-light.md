| I have seen a city
| of purest light
| a brilliant white
| the end of night.
|
| I did not see it
| with these eyes
| nor have I
| any description.
|
| It could be
| mere fantasy
| an errant wish,
| a mirage of faith.
|
| How do I know
| if it's real?
|
| Look for its reflection
| in the shape of hope
| a positive mind
| an ever-simmering joy.
