| Tell me, whether wisps of cloud
| may be brought down by hand
| and added to my collection of dreams.
|
| I had bottled the wind in my heart,
| but she blew no more,
| as the light died, that my eyes captured,
| the moment the lids were closed.
|
| I have tried so long
| to build a heaven in my heart's chambers;
| I'd forgotten where I placed the door.
|
| "Step outside," I hear the voice now:
| the cry of that wind,
| the shining of that light.
|
| They forgive me, and call me out,
| and even that cloud
| cries no more.
