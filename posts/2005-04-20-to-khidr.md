| O Khidr!
| My tricky friend
|   and true,
| my green Satan,
| my soul-destroyer...
|
| You've pounded my heart
| into a tasty morsel,
| thrust me onto a skewer,
| and roasted me like kabob.
|
| I never knew I could be so delicious.
|
| The friends of God do not understand
|   my love for you.
| They think me mad, of no account;
| they imagine my joy is from
|   lack of understanding.
|
| I tell your tales and do my part,
| but even if they hear me
| they don't listen.
|
| As for me, I choose that
|   wild and reckless dance!
| headlong into the fire.
|
| Turn me over the coals --
|   again, and yet again --
| that I may wear this
|   blackened char of self
|   as my crown of glory.
