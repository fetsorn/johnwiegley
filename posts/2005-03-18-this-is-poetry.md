| Sometimes, only poems will do.
|
| The words as they meet the paper
| sing with a subtle voice,
| a quiet, ringing tone
| that resounds in the heart:
| this is poetry.
|
| So I lift my pen, my wand
| and conjure fair spells
| to entrance the heart
| and grant the power to fly...
|
| Poetry is a doorway to impossible lands.
