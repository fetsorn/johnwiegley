| The tree
| digs its roots deep
| drawing out
| nourishment and means
| from the Earth.
|
| It stands tall
| stretching out boughs
| to receive the Light
| that shines down
| from Heaven.
|
| It yields fruit
| for others to live by;
| gives shelter
| to those below
| and a home to those above.
|
| It marries
| the two Kingdoms
| of ground and sky
| into a beautiful
| bountiful creation.
|
| If a man
| could learn
| such secrets as these
| he would know
| his place in the world.
