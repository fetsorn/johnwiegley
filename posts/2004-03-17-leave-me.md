| Leave me to sit by the rutilant flames,
| mesmerized
| having lost every opportunity of success in your world.
|
| And with my dying breath I shall blow a kiss
| that no one will understand;
| for my last breath is gone now,
| and why?
|
| Having made "nothing" of myself,
| I am invisible to you.
