| I look at the moon:
| two innocent spheres of white
| joined by light with a kindred form.
|
| My spirit is already there:
| only my body holds back:
| since gravity has thrown about a cloak
| which my being wears
| reluctantly.
|
| And the cloak is the body itself:
| a fleshy jacket
| to retard the soul's celerity.
|
| Otherwise, I would blaze out
| in a single instant
| and make my home upon that star,
| in the fields of infinite beauty.
