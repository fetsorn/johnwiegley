| If all the world is perfect
| within a grander scheme,
| tomorrow's bitter cup
| is sweeter than it seems.
|
| If eyes be taught this Way
| of seeing past the veil,
| they'd find an end to pain;
| so would happiness prevail!
|
| For darkness hasn't essence
| to bear against the Light;
| whose first arrows of dawn
| are fatal to the night.
|
| Until they ask:
| Mustn't night, too, succeed day?
| To which I answer:
| The Sun never sets;
|   it's the Earth that turns away.
