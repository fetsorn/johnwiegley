title: That perfect moment
tags: poetry
---

| I was not made to be perfect.
| I was made flawed, for that moment
| when I discover perfection despite myself --
| because I willed it with a earnest heart.
|
| The beauty of the rose emerges from soil,
| and the finest spring day, after winter's toil;
| A reed is cracked, that the pen's ink may flow,
| as a lover's mind is broken, for the heart to know.
