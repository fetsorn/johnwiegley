| What is it
| that hounds me in the dark?
| in the lonely hours,
| in the still and secret places...
|
| My heart is a hunter
| that stalks my mind.
|
| I hide in the daylight --
| but when all is quiet
| it still finds me.
|
| I have heard it said:
| "There is something about
| the dark sanctity of the night
| that beckons me."
|
| I fully agree.
