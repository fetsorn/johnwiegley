title: I've found you

| I have waited so long for a companion,
| with whom, hand in hand,
| we could sit by the ocean
| and unravel the experiences we've each had with life --
|
| Not our everyday encounters,
| but real life
|
| Come!  Come!  Be with me.
|
| I want to hear our voices carry us
| into the darkest recesses of the night.
