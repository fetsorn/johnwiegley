| We all struggle with the mind duel,
| grappling the what if, for the what may be.
| Softly, our voices in the heat of flame
| fearing what gasses we breath turning into fire.
|
| There is a building world of rage,
| clawing its venom through the deep silence,
| cloaking the honesty of the heart:
| wary, we step on no ground... lest we wake.
|
| See the dreamer in his troubled sleep?
| fits of terror; a twitching, wretched agony.
| He longs to rise though he grips the sheets so tight;
| his knuckles white, cotton bunched -- dreadful night!
|
| I am the roar of the blessed lion!
| wandering in forests of the mind of every man.
| When I exit this maze you've meant to trap me,
| the wind will fall on all your empty tears.
