| The longing of a lover's eyes,
| draped in fire,
| fanned by the agony of time;
| neither sleep, nor food,
| only the sublimity of the heart's emotion,
| seeking out that kiss
| which transforms him into nothing...
|
| Only as nothing can the human heart
| withstand the lover's stare;
| only as empty can it be filled,
| only as void can it know being --
| like the ear which does not speak
| and the mouth which does not hear,
| as long as we proclaim, proclaim, unceasing,
| her words cannot be heard:
| "I am here."
