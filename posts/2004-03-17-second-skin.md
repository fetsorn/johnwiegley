| Even as mystery is an air
| which surrounds us in the dead of night;
|
| And silence has its own sound,
| audible as a deafening roar
| when truly we hear it deeply:
|
| So everything about us has
| a deeper nature,
| a second skin,
| which requires our utmost attention to perceive it.
|
| Otherwise,
| in the falling leaves of the redwoods
| one sees nothing but those leaves,
| and misses them for the wonderful tapestry they are.
