| Human thought is a parade of ignorance:
| our mind begets the shadows on the cave's wall:
| what does it mean to go forth into the light?
|
| When we bow in reverence, the mind is stilled,
| and only the feelings of the heart fill time.
| Who is the speaker in that silence?
|
| There is a self behind our thoughts, maybe a "not self",
| in which every mystery is hidden by rays of light.
|
| As these unfold, a brightness awakens the mind;
| thus, through blindness, we first come to know the truth.
