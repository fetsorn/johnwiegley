| The real desert
| is a space between the mountains.
| A hollow in the green and watered Earth.
|
| It stretches out
| and fills with its own emptiness;
| the silence is crowded
| by a thousand unheard things.
|
| Its song of wind blows and blows
| drifting the sands about.
| I watch the long, lonely dance.
| It is never and always the same.
