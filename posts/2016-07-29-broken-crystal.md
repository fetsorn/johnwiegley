| I lived upon a landscape of broken crystal.
| My eyes were closed, and my feet, bleeding.
|
| One day I awoke with the sun in my face...
| And I fell in love,
| and my heart became a mortal cup, filled with light.
|
| I looked across the land as the Daystar rose
| and all those crystal thorns became as one:
| drops of the sun,
| diamonds of fire,
| a treasure of light
| unbounded.
