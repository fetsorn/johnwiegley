| Dear reader!
|
| You are the unsought treasure.
| The jewel mistaken for glass.
| The sleeping queen taken for a peasant.
|
| Awaken your true self!
| You are the gateway, the hidden door,
| the catalyst for what might be.
|
| A painting in a lightless cave
|   is equal to the pressing void.
| You were made to catch the light;
| to reveal its beauty secrets.
|
| Your nature is never far from Him.
| Only: the unlit candle
|   knows nothing at first
| of Heat and Flame.
