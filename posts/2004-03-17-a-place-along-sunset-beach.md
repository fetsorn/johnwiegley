title: A place along sunset beach

| Where the ever-deepening silence
| collects into quiet pools of sound,
| and the waves of light
| issuing from far-off beacons
| touch my fingertips as I lift them to my face,
|
| I understand that here is
| a holy place,
| where holy thoughts, and holy deeds,
| have made sacred
| a once ordinary ground.
