title: My life is my life
tags: poetry

| They wonder why I need to be free from the world,
| but their wonder is their wonder
| and my life is my life.
|
| Any attempt to break free is labelled "heresy",
| as they struggle to hold me down --
| for my life is my life.
|
| I don't expect "let me be" to go over with anyone
| but at least leave me to decide my own dreams.
| My life is my life, and despite it all
| I intend to live it.
