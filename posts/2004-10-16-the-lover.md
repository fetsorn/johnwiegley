| A lover hasn't the heart for knowledge
| nor the patience for study.
| He already knows to perfection
| when the Beloved is near.
|
| Does a thirsty man sit and
| debate the words for water?
| Give him one glass, and he will
| drink the truth of them all.
|
| Such a one does not notice pain.
| In him, all things are consumed.
| He glows with inner heat;
| his eyes are embers from the fire.
|
| Yet because of that negation
| he feels Her touch like no other;
| because he burns with unending thirst
| a drop tells the mystery of oceans.
|
| Thus, the lover takes to pain
| like a student to a favored lesson:
| for insofar as he writhes in agony
| Her merest word of balm is revelation.
