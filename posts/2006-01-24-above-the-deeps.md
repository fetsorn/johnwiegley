| It led the way before me:
| cool, and dark
| an unending ribbon of night
| stretching to meet the horizon.
|
| Its waters had captured an image of heaven --
| toying with its lights,
| setting the stars to dancing
| and making of the moon
|   a disk of liquid silver.
|
| What fish gathered below,
| I wondered?
| what denizens of the mighty river
| to contemplate my evening ride?
|
| Yet the boat leapt on, quick prow
| slicing through the splashing black;
| my face catching the wind
| and those untamed waters, my soul.
