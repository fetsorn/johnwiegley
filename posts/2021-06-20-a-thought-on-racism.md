title: A thought on racism

A thought I had this week: We have two deep problems regarding racism in this
country: A policy problem, and a love problem. Anti-racism is an effective
stance with regard to policy, but it does not move the needle very far on the
matter of love: Not just including, but cherishing; not just accepting, but
befriending; not just supporting, but sacrificing for love’s sake. It’s this
heart-distance that has allowed the policy problem to sink such deep roots.
