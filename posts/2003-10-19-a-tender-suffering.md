| A tender suffering, you once taught me --
| your eyes the lesson, your smile the book;
|
| It was a tale unlike the songs of heaven
| that the choir boys whisper in their nook;
|
| Of sweet death you then instructed me,
| and the truth of longing's demise:
|
| That to love another One so deeply
| is a pain only union can deny...
