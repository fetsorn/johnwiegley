| The blue thumbprints of an artist's proof,
| labelled on white spheres of alabaster
| deep set into a skull of ash
| baked in a stone oven.
|
| Befriend the troubled -- his last ray of hope
| as a blooded sun casts shadows
| on the pitiless hearts of those
| who would call him nothing.
|
| Terrified, lonely, consorting with demons
| that abide ever between heart and mind,
| all waiting to lead unwary souls to
| the yawning gates of perdition.
