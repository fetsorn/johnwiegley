| The vapors rising off the ice:
| a sublime landscape of winter:
| arctic pieces of the sea trapped
| in the white amber of millennia.
|
| The seals below bump their heads,
| the bears in white coats rumble their hunger;
| against the black night, the white fox howls
| and the rabbit hears him in the echoes of sleep.
