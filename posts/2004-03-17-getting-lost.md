| We are all butterflies,
| heading on our way to somewhere wonderful.
|
| Then one foot gets stuck in the web.
| And rather than peeling it off
| and continuing on our way,
| we feel compelled to look further --
| when there's nothing further to see!
|
| So it happens that each step
| entangles us deeper and deeper.
| Soon we'll never fly again.
|
| Then the spider comes
| and our blood is sucked dry.
| We are nothing left
| but a dry carcass, troubled by the wind.
