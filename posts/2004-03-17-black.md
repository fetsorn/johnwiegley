| Empty days, spotted nights of
| countless camphor drops
| or milky dew on a
| silent web of gossamer black.
|
| The cold night is home to
| so much fire -- a billion suns!
| too much light to belong
| to those depths of endless black.
|
| How could all those distant
| daylight worlds,
| taken together,
| sum to such a lonely, empty black?
|
| Perhaps their days are empty too
| all glimmer with no shine;
| sleeping midnight jellyfish, or
| white glowbugs trapped
| in a vast amber turned black.
