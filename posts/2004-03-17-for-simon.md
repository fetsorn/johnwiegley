| How many kind eyes
| look out at the world?
|
| How much laughter
| do we hear?
|
| How much courtesy
| graces the name "humanity"?
|
| Today, we are one less.
|
| And outside my window,
| where I used to see his truck,
| the great arms of the loquat tree
| have folded, and broken.
|
| Half of that tree lies silent now on the ground.
|
| It could no longer sustain
| its burden of sorrow.
