| The wind one morning
| carried Your voice to me;
| but when I turned my head
|   it was gone.
|
| Looking up one night
| a sparkling Light caught my eye;
| but when I turned my head
|   it was gone.
|
| A fragrance on the breeze
| enchanted both heart and mind;
| but when I turned my head
|   it was gone.
|
| Until at last
| the thought came to me:
|   Why do I keep turning away?
