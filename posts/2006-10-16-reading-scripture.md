| If a wise man speaks to a fool,
| he will use the fool's language --
| lest the language of the wise
| lead him to greater folly.
|
| Yet if the fool pays too much heed
| to the words and forms adopted,
| he will mostly see in them
| the shape of his own reflection...
|
| He should wonder less the form,
| and more what could not fit it:
|
|   Forget the drop, drying on your nose;
|   ponder the clouds and thunder.
