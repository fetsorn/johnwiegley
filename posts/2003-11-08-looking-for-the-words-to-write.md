title: Looking for the words to write
tags: poetry
---

| Today they have all left me:
| the everyday words we use with one another,
| the everyday thoughts---the worries forever.
|
| I can feel the dreams inside me
| struggling to find their way,
|
| Looking for the words to write
| that will brush the clouds from the sun.
|
| Then the spring of hope begins
| and eyes shine with fire and storm...
|
| Still, no one notices, and the crowds walk by.
| But a process has begun
| that one day might bloom
|
| Into the kind of words I'm looking for
| to write, to express
| how many of these dreams are of you.
