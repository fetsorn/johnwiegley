| The rivers of people are all of colored drops;
| at a distance they merge
| into a changeless, constant stream.
|
| It is never the same form,
| but always the same shape;
| Heraclitus would recognize it.
|
| They flow, they catch
| on sandbars of momentary interest.
| Among the statues and churches --
| the deeps and shallows --
| the course of flow is changed,
| flinging up waves onto steps, doors, patios.
|
| There are bargemen in steel coaches
| canoers on their bikes
| even traffic cops to direct the flow.
|
| Funny that winter
| does not freeze them solid.
| So many separate drops;
| it makes one dream of waterfalls...
