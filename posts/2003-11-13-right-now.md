| Only when I think I have something
| can I fear losing it.
| Only when I think I know something
| can I doubt knowing it.
|
| For having and not having are absolutes,
| as is knowing and not knowing.
| Any feeling of need to think on it --
| is its own answer.
|
| Don't try to know what you don't;
| don't extend the concept of possession.
| In your own hands, right now,
| is the only fact:
| and what your heart is sure of,
| right now
| is the only knowledge.
