| Landing after so long a flight
| turning on the hot water
| washing the stains of travel...
|
| The bed welcomes like a lover,
| the clean sheets embrace me,
| the pillow's constant touch is a kiss.
|
| I left another continent tonight,
| adding its fair memories
| to the book of my heart's history.
