My summary of the beauty of Bahá'í law:

Human beings are created as perfect instruments for perceiving and appreciating the Divine (i.e., "to know and to worship God").

Like any instrument, we are governed by principles, just as a car or a violin is. In order for that instrument to achieve its best performance and maximum potential, it must be used in accordance with those principles: properly tuned, used within the right constraints, not exceeding certain limits, etc. When you find the "sweet spot" for any instrument's intended use, it is like light upon light.

Everything that makes us happy and fulfilled in this life derives its qualities from this fundamental relationship we were created to achieve, serving us like echoes or shadows cast, meant to inspire us foward.

But leading beyond this is a road to far greater stations and realities, so far undreamt of. To pass along this road, we must be properly attuned and attired. This is the purpose of the law of God. It is in no way about restriction or limitation, but about sharpening and dilating the eye so it may see all that it was created to see.
