I’ve endured the pain of love… do not ask
I’ve drunk the poison of remoteness… do not ask

I've ventured to the ends of the earth
only to return to my mistress… do not ask

The mere dust of her passing by
brings tears to my eyes… do not ask

With my own ears last night, from her mouth
I heard her speak… do not ask

For me, as when you bite the lip to keep silent,
I’ve bitten lips ruby red… do not ask

When I'm without you, in my beggar’s hovel
I suffer every affliction… do not ask

Thus is Hafez a stranger in the way of love:
I've arrived at the station of… do not ask.
