I love how abstract these things can get. So hard to describe what you're
thinking. But we can try, and fail, and share in the silliness as we do.

Imagine there were a circle, a plain 2-dimensional space. On that circle was a
point, moving this way and that. The point sees itself as a separate entity,
and wonders about the vast range of the circle, and why one side is so
different from another. The circle, meanwhile, simply regards the point as a
*locus*, a momentary focus, knowing that as it ranges about the circle, it
sees many different things; while the circle abides.

In your own life, you dwell at the locus of what could be considered a larger
entity. I don't mean large physically, I mean in the way that raindrops, and
the umbrella they fall on, are points within a larger space we term "rain".
It's natural, in each moment, to see them as separate, and define them
independently; but in another sense, there's a common entity that gives them
meaning and one can intuit this reality in addition to the points.

There's one scifi book,
[Quarantine](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Quarantine_(Egan_novel)) where I feel
this idea was nicely touched upon. In that novel, he uses quantum incoherence
to express the idea of an "unbounded self", with the "locus" being the state
chosen by our will out of many potential eigenstates. Great read.

Anyway, long story short: you hurt when you fall or embarass yourself because
you identify with the one who fell. Living in the locus. I could quote lots of
stuff about Mind here, but if you know where I'm headed, I don't need to; and
if you don't, I'd just fail louder.
