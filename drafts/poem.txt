Only the self
makes note of
the odor of self.

To the real Real
there's just
a mewling infant:

sometimes stinking
sometimes fresh;
always growing
always changing.



The seeker's true enemy is finding.
A moth doesn't collect embers.
No shadow is an expert on daylight.


This is a game you lose by playing, since "stopping" and "thinking" are just
more concepts used to modulate our experience of... whatever it is that we
are.

If you didn't have "red" and "blue", how many colors would there be? What
would be the difference between them?

"Stopping" isn't choosing between having such thoughts and not having them;
it's when even that distinction loses its grip.

> This Mind, which is without beginning, is unborn and indestructible... It
  does not belong to the categories of things which exist or do not exist...
  It is that which you see before you -- begin to reason about it and you at
  once fall into error. It is like the boundless void which cannot be fathomed
  or measured. The One Mind alone is the Buddha, and there is no distinction
  between the Buddha and sentient things, but that sentient beings are
  attached to forms and so seek externally for Buddhahood. By their very
  seeking they lose it, for that is using the Buddha to seek for the Buddha
  and using mind to grasp Mind. Even though they do their utmost for a full
  aeon, they will not be able to attain it. They do not know that, if they put
  a stop to conceptual thought and forget their anxiety, the Buddha will
  appear before them, for this Mind is the Buddha..." -- Huang Po
