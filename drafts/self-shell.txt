The shell of the seed is hard, so hard! and there is nothing for it but to be
thrust into damp and dark and be given patience, water, fertilizer and time.

I think we are all beautiful souls, but potential within the shell of self and
limitation. Some will germinate; some fall on stony soil and need relocation.

Yet how the farmer regards the seed is different from the miller. One sees the
merit of todayâ€™s reality; the other ten or a hundred years further on.
