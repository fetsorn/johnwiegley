The shell of the seed is hard, so hard! and there is nothing for it but to be
thrust into damp and dark and given patience, water, fertilizer and time.

I think we are all beautiful souls, but potential within the shell of self and
limitation. Some will germinate; some fall on stony soil and need relocation.

Yet how the farmer regards the seed is different from the miller. One sees the
merit of today’s reality; the other ten or a hundred years further on.


Only the self
takes note of
the odor of self.

To the real real
there's just
a mewling infant:

sometimes stinking
sometimes fresh;
always growing
always changing.


There is no greater barrier in our journey than the boundaries of self. It is
a prison whose walls we cannot break, since our own desire strengthens them.
We are the narrators of our existence, deeply believing in the stories we tell
ourselves: a shadow world pulled over the eyes, a mirage of imagination.


The real truth is a spiritual truth: that your being is unspeakably glorious,
but like an uncut gem, its inherent brilliance is not yet perceived. It is
culture that has us seeing only a rock, and this can become transmogrified
into self-hatred and a story of insufficiency and bleakness.


The man who does not know is ill-served by his conception of what he seeks to
learn.


"Here" and "there" have separated us.
For all my wandering is nothing more
than the distance between me and Thee.


If life is a crucible of the spirit,
pride shouldn’t be taken in that
fortune excluded you from suffering;
but in that you learned from it --
or had the fortitude to survive.


A goodly character can lift the story of a person's life to the rank of
literature.
