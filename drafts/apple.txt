The truth we know is a concept, a proof that something is well-defined based
on what we’re willing to accept.

An "apple" is not true, nor does it exist. It's a name for what you hold in
your hand. For example, you may think that the apple occupies a clearly
defined space, but our ability to smell is because its molecules permeate the
surrounding air. The distinction between “apple” and “not apple“ is chosen
based on the senses, not what evidently is.

Common-sense truths are shorthands and many of them are wrong in greater
contexts. The appearance of objects also is a function of time, of
probabilities continually in electro-static juxtaposition. We impose the
normal on the incredible and call it the plain truth.
