It taxes one’s sense of reality to see dehumanization actively taking place in
the news, online, in the attitudes of friends... When did anyone have to
qualify for decency, respect, love, or justice? History is so depressing in
this regard and we are still not past it. We’re just not as evolved yet as we
think we are. All humans deserve the same assumption of dignity and potential
as everyone else. Until then, expect to be exhausted convincing people of the
obvious.
