some key concepts:

financial goal: How much return do you need from this money each year? 1%? Beat inflation? Beat market? 20%? How do you want the money to work for you?

risk tolerance: How much of your capital can you lose before your financial goals are compromised? Can you lose 10% of the total?

risk limits: Never put more than 1-2% of your capital at risk in any one trade; spread the risk across multiple trades.

exit strategy: Before entering a trade, decide how much you can lose, and either enter a stop loss order to sell at that price or lower, or stay on top of the position and place the order manually when it's time.

profit goal: Decide at which percentage profit you will exit, or if you choose to "let it ride" for a long-term hold. If the purpose of the position is to collect a dividend, you may never sell it.

liquidity: What if you need to sell to make cash available, are you OK doing that if the position is at a loss at that time?

position sizing: Sometimes the right trade can have the wrong size. Pick the size whose typical swings up or down fit within the other criteria you've established above.

dollar cost averaging: instead of buying a price X, buy smaller sets of shares at multiple times, averaging the cost either up or down depending on the behavior of the market during that time.

FOMO: "Fear of missing out". Never ever let this be the reason you invest!

doubling down: If you invest in a stock that goes down further, don't assume it's now an even better buy at that price. Decide ahead of time how many shares you intend to own, and stick to that number, no matter how "cheap" it gets. This is also called "throwing good money after bad".
