You keep repeating the same things over and over, but that's not a way to
convince me of anything. I really get the feeling that you're not talking to
*me*, but at me or past me.

To my ears it sounds like a man standing on the shore of a great ocean, with
an accurate measuring cup in hand, shouting to all who will listen: "See
what's in my cup? They lie! This ocean is not deep blue as they say; it has no
waves, no whales of the deep, no pearls of great price. Look at my cup! It may
be wet, but so is my saliva, what need is there? It will not even quench my
thirst."
