The Covenant of God, to use a scientific analogy, is why we have the
confidence to call certain natural observations “laws” while wholeheartedly
basing our lives on those principles. After all, nothing says that gravity
must always be, yet it endures with a faithfulness that no one questions. One
ignores it at their peril.
