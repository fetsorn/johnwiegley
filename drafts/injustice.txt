I think injustice always needs to be addressed, regardless of magnitude or how
egregious it is compared to history. If I break my arm skiing, and the doctor
sets it, and I come back with a complaint about my hand still being sore, he
doesn't say, "Look, we can't talk about your hand until you acknowledge how
much progress there's been on your arm." The job of a doctor is to heal
injury, not to argue context or how much I feel pain. And a job of
civilization is to identify and remedy injustice. Study after study after
study shows a disparity and disadvantage to certain segments of our
population. As long as that remains true, I may indeed be interested in how
history has led us to this moment, but I'm not going to pat anybody on the
back for being less racist than they were before. Until the problem is gone,
there is no cause for celebration.
