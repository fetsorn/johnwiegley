Do you find the idea of loving strangers as if they were friends a worthwhile
mystery? Religion, as I understand it, does not seek to replace science. To
use a metaphor: If science is a vehicle that drives my body to the shore,
religion is that sea which my soul longs to explore. There is too much in life
-- our friendship even -- that cannot be rendered into evidence or
measurements. There are other depths to plumb, and I have no papers or degrees
to explain them.

BahÃ¡â€™uâ€™llÃ¡h: "The pen steppeth not into this region, the ink leaveth only a
blot. In these planes, the nightingale of the heart hath other songs and
secrets, which make the heart to stir and the soul to clamor, but this mystery
of inner meaning may be whispered only from heart to heart, confided only from
breast to breast."

And even though the above cautions me to silence, we could still try to talk
about it; it's mostly Facebook chat that makes it harder than it needs to be.
