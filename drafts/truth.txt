Truth is a concept, a proof that something is well defined based on what
you’re willing to accept.

The apple is not true, nor does it exist. It is a name for what you hold in
your hand. For example, you think that the apple occupies a clearly defined
space, but your ability to smell is because its molecules also permeate the
surrounding air. The distinction between “apple” and “not apple“ is one you
choose based on your senses, not one that evidently is.

Common-sense truths are shorthands, and many of them are wrong if held in
greater contexts. The appearance of objects is also a function of time, of
probabilities continually in electro-static juxtaposition. We impose the
normal on the incredible, and call it the plain truth.
