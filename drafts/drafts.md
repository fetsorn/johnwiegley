The shell of the seed is hard, so hard! and there is nothing for it but to be
thrust into damp and dark and given patience, water, fertilizer and time.

I think we are all beautiful souls, but potential within the shell of self and
limitation. Some will germinate; some fall on stony soil and need relocation.

Yet how the farmer regards the seed is different from the miller. One sees the
merit of today’s reality; the other ten or a hundred years further on.

There is no greater barrier in our journey than the boundaries of self. It is
a prison whose walls we cannot break, since our own desire strengthens them.
We are the narrators of our existence, deeply believing in the stories we tell
ourselves: a shadow world pulled over the eyes, a mirage of imagination.

The real truth is a spiritual truth: that your being is unspeakably glorious
but like an uncut gem, its inherent brilliance is not yet perceived. It is
culture that has us seeing only a rock, which can become transmogrified into
self-hatred and a story of insufficiency and bleakness.

Being too hard on yourself is ego too: measuring yourself harshly against a
standard derived from your own understanding. The path forward is a free and
humble heart, continuously learning and turning toward God and joy. “Ego”
arises from ideas that ossify into a false sense of reality — whether within
or without — and become veils between us and the Loved One.

For me, the essence of it is that our focus should be on the beauty and hearts
of our fellow believers, and the work we do on ourselves and our understanding
should be to deepen and enrich and make true that connection. This is in
opposition to the attitude of primarily concerning myself with my own
deficiencies and trying to become “better”, which centers the inner debate on
myself, and not on those whom I wish to know and love better.

The Covenant of God, to use a scientific analogy, is why we have the

ignores it at their peril.

# The meaning of faith

Faith is being certain you will succeed
when all signs point to failure;
or hearing a friend has betrayed you,
but feeling no pause in your love
until you’ve learned the whole truth;
or listening sincerely to fools,
since knowledge is sometimes hidden;
being uncertain of your ability,
yet confident things will work out;
and never becoming cynical or jaded
or unwilling to look for the best in people.

The truth we know is a concept, a proof that something is well-defined based
on what we’re willing to accept.

An "apple" is not true, nor does it exist. It's a name for what you hold in
your hand. For example, you may think that the apple occupies a clearly
defined space, but our ability to smell is because its molecules permeate the
surrounding air. The distinction between “apple” and “not apple“ is chosen
based on the senses, not what evidently is.

Scientific evidence is used to confirm or deny our theories about physical
reality. It doesn’t "tell" us anything about realities outside of human
awareness and understanding. Sometimes a discovery will point to something we
don’t see yet, and this expands our vision, but never has a phenomenon
explained to us what the universe is, or why it behaves the way it does.

Common-sense truths are shorthands and many of them are wrong in greater
contexts. The appearance of objects likewise is a function of time, of
probabilities in electro-static tension. We impose the normal on the
incredible and call it the plain truth.

# What is it like to be a deeply religious person?

Date: 2017-08-12

Mostly for me it means thinking all the same thoughts you do, but with the
addition of the following:

 1. Existence includes more than the physical world we see.
 2. People have an aspect to them, the soul, that continues beyond this
    experience of life.
 3. The laws of all these worlds was laid down by a conscious Being.
 4. Individuals have been chosen to communicate these laws, and certain
    details of the world beyond.

I don’t believe in God or the other worlds by themselves because I can’t see
them, and have no experiential evidence of any kind that they exist. The crux
of the matter comes down to believing whomever says they are real (e.g.,
Jesus, Muhammad, Moses, etc.).

I think the real difference to “religious thinking” (for many religions,
though not all) is the integration into one’s world view that these realities
not only exist, but my actions here impact how I connect to them; that I have
a soul, and certain qualities (faith, love, how I act) impact the welfare of
that soul.

That said, as a Bahá’í I believe that scientific truth should trump religious
truth when the two disagree, since the former is based on real evidence, while
the latter is too easily subject to personal opinions and point of view.

# What is the science behind faith, many people believe God is not real but the feeling/power of faith is interesting?

Date: 2017-03-13

Many seem to think that belief in God should be based on His being obvious,
and easily proven to exist. Yet the nature of this life, with all its apparent
contradictions, causes me to wonder if His not being obvious is part of the
point of why we’re here.

Say you’re the most famous person in all of existence; wouldn’t you like to
know who your real friends are before you let them into your home? And as
Hollywood has shown in many films, sometimes you don’t discover who your real
friends are until you test them.

# What is it like to feel the holy spirit?

I'm curious to know what its like to feel the holy spirits presence. I've had
no prior experience with it whatsoever.

Date: 2017-02-09

It's hard to know whether a personal experience is really the Holy Spirit, or
just personal imagination, but for me: imagine laying back into a warm bath,
the heat moving into your body as if by fingers of some unseen light, and
suddenly you feel as if you've always known this feeling, womb-like, showing a
path before you whose wonderful mysteries can never cease to unfold. There is
very little that compares to it; even the things that do (on a physical level)
have a sense of shallow fleetingness that does not begin to compare with the…
endless promise of this other thing. It feels like coming home, if home is
where you've always longed to be, even since you were just two cells put
together.

# How does someone with a genius IQ conceive of God?

Date: 2016-11-25

Genius is not a well defined term, and the range of IQs it has been applied to
is large. For some definitions I fit within that range, for others I do not.
That said, I am believer in God, despite having this intelligence.

If you ask me how I conceive of God: I don’t. “God” is at best a symbol used
by humans to refer to a Reality we can never hope to understand — not to any
extent. We don’t even know how our own minds work, so it’s ludicrous to think
we could fathom the Creator of that mind: or love, or the human soul. I barely
understand why I prefer blueberries to raspberries; how I claim to know God?

What I believe in is those Divine Messengers who claim to have brought us
knowledge from God. Why I believe this is personal, and a different question
altogether. Yet even when these Individuals tell me that God exists and has a
plan for us, I still don’t know Who that God is, or the nature of His Essence.

That said, an infant doesn’t need to comprehend its mother to know her love,
or feed from her milk, nor does it need an accurate conception of her to have
a strong and lasting relationship.

# How did you feel when you first scratched your new car and how did you deal with the depression?

Date: 2016-11-22

There have been times when I scratched the thing I loved most by myself, just
to face the craziness head on.

I completely sympathize with what you’re feeling: You get that new thing —
something which embodies whatever ideals you long for at the moment:
sleekness, speed, utility, freedom from the doldrums of life — and reality
jumps up and smacks your ideal right across the face, leaving a mark that
can’t be fixed, that stares you in the face, mockingly, with eyes of fire
every time you look at it. It makes you want to throw the thing away and start
over.

In a way, we taste a little bit of death in these moments: the death of some
fleeting thing that we thought we had, for a moment, captured in our new
vehicle, or TV, or computer. For one brief instant, we’d reached into the
world of perfect forms, and come away with a vision of beauty so wondrous, so
smooth…

It’s funny that we, creatures of an impermanent and ever-changing world, find
such joy in these moments. Almost as if we weren’t born for this, and all
these terrible experiences and sudden depressions were specifically intended
to hone our appreciation for such things, while at the same time learning to
let them free.

# What is it that God desires the most of us?

Date: 2016-11-18

Your life is a gift. Open it. Learn who you are, who you were made to be, the
fullness of your potential. The Prophets came to guide us in these things, so
I would say that what God desires is for us to fully be.

I love how abstract these things can get. So hard to describe what you're
thinking. But we can try, and fail, and share in the silliness as we do.

Imagine there were a circle, a plain 2-dimensional space. On that circle was a
point, moving this way and that. The point sees itself as a separate entity,
and wonders about the vast range of the circle, and why one side is so
different from another. The circle, meanwhile, simply regards the point as a
*locus*, a momentary focus, knowing that as it ranges about the circle, it
sees many different things; while the circle abides.

In your own life, you dwell at the locus of what could be considered a larger
entity. I don't mean large physically, I mean in the way that raindrops, and
the umbrella they fall on, are points within a larger space we term "rain".
It's natural, in each moment, to see them as separate, and define them
independently; but in another sense, there's a common entity that gives them
meaning and one can intuit this reality in addition to the points.

There's one scifi book,
[Quarantine](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Quarantine_(Egan_novel)) where I feel
this idea was nicely touched upon. In that novel, he uses quantum incoherence
to express the idea of an "unbounded self", with the "locus" being the state
chosen by our will out of many potential eigenstates. Great read.

Anyway, long story short: you hurt when you fall or embarass yourself because
you identify with the one who fell. Living in the locus. I could quote lots of
stuff about Mind here, but if you know where I'm headed, I don't need to; and
if you don't, I'd just fail louder.

It taxes one’s sense of reality to see dehumanization actively taking place in
the news, online, in the attitudes of friends... When did anyone have to
qualify for decency, respect, love, or justice? History is so depressing in
this regard and we are still not past it. We’re just not as evolved yet as we
think we are. All humans deserve the same assumption of dignity and potential
as everyone else. Until then, expect to be exhausted convincing people of the
obvious.

# Going off the rails, slowly

An observation on Zen, as I see it spoken of in this community and online.

It's as though a new plant, growing in the forest, suddenly became aware of
itself and how different it is from everything else. Obsessed with its
differences it begins to enumerate them, define them, magnify them. Pretty
soon it knows what it is and what other things aren't and this is its world.

Enter Zen. Without saying that the plant is not a plant, Zen breaks down the
names and divisions, until the plant begins to see something that was
invisible before, since it's everywhere and nowhere: the ecosystem as a whole.
Of course, the ecosystem doesn't exist in any one place, you can't point to
it, you can't see it operating, but the whole organism of the forest is this
ecosystem and everything a momentary part of its operation. This is why the
plant is there, its role, and why it must also leave at some point. In this
view, life and death are not in conflict, they aren't even really divided.
There is just the great ongoing life of it all, ever-changing, always the
same.

Enter Zen practitioners. While Zen implies a degree of selflessness such that
the plant sees its own being as both essential to its awareness (being where
its see things from) and completely inessential -- sort of the way a body is
necessarily made up of cells, but no one cell is more "the body" than any
other -- Zen practitioners that I've read about seem to have gone off the
rails at some point, rather slowly. Instead of the plant unifying with the
undefinable ecosystem, it instead uproots itself, finds a lonely mountain or
social enclave apart from the majority, and settles itself there to stare at a
wall and contemplate nothing at all. Being empty of thought is "The Way", even
if the tenth ox painting sees you back at the tavern.

I just wouldn't expect Zen to lead anyone to think they were apart from me, or
better than me, or beyond me. I would expect them to know themselves *as* me
-- our real me -- without thought needed for it to be obvious.

I also think Zen gets confused with the purpose of life. I see it as a
rigorous methodology suited to becoming aware of, and then popping, the
non-existent-yet-interfering bubble of illusion with which the human mind is
entrapped due to how our thinking evolved from childhood. If you will, it aims
at birthing us from the caul of adolescent consciousness.

However, it says *almost nothing* about what is seen and experienced beyond
this point, since any attempt to do so would convey information that cannot,
by definition, be correctly processed.

Could you be an awakened person who adheres to a physical regimen of
systematic hedonism? I don't see why not. If anything, you simply wouldn't be
led by conceptions about it, or be attached to it as a means of emotive
ideation. Could you go the opposite direction and adhere to self-flagellating
asceticism? Sure. In this sense, I understand the method of Zen to be
"a-systematic", in that it eliminates the artificial systems we cling to, by
awakening to their non-being, in order to leave you free to interact with the
world how you will.

On the flip side, I take issue with the example presented by Bodhidharma,
which seems to suggest that the pinnacle of an awakened mind is to sit in
front of a wall for a decade. When Zen is taken to be "the whole deal", it
becomes far too nihilistic. It then seems to offer nothing but the elimination
of all established meaning, anywhere and everywhere, and leaving behind only
silence and void.

Instead, I think cancelling the "self" by means of awakening to the
ever-present void is merely the first moment of awareness, like waking up
after a long slumber. There is an entire world beyond that point, and none of
it (thankfully!) is to be found in the Writings of Zen masters. I admire the
purity of their devotion to exposing delusion, leaving us with no false dreams
to cling to.

Zen is great at striking you dumb in the face of mystery; but it should not be
seen as diminishing, in the slightness, the greatness of that mystery, or how
much is yet to be known of this existence.

The idea here is not that Zen isn't an additive game: it's that you're not
required to play any game, no matter how real or necessary others believe it
to be. How you react to a situation, how you feel about it, how you see it, is
not determined by that situation or forced upon you, but arises from the fact
that *you agreed to play by its rules*. You can't find your way out by gaming
the system or beating the rules, as that only gives them further strength and
validity. You have to see the nature of your imprisonment and then you can
decide what you want to do, freely.

# Marriage

Marriage is a great suggestion, if you find a good partner who understands you
and your aspirations. I'd like to offer some advice, though, on the matter
itself.

I grew up with a pretty strong case of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder -- as in
I felt the need to touch door frames a certain number of times before I could
pass through them without anxiety. So I know what you mean by the struggle
between low compulsions and high intentions. I've also had a few decades to
think about it in the context of the Bahá’í Writings and becoming a
functioning member of the community.

First and foremost, you didn't choose this. God gives us our preferences and
inclinations. Society makes it FAR worse than it would have been in a simpler
age. What matters now is how we cope with the challenge. But I want you to
take yourself off the hook for the mere existence of the challenge itself.
Nothing bad or evil about yourself lead to this moment. Some of us are just
prone to addictive behavior. (If I had ever touched a cigarette in my youth,
I'd be a hopeless chain smoker right now).

The steed of the first valley is patience, and it is a very profound sort of
patience. Even if you find that your journey would last a hundred thousand
years, it says you should not falter. Imagine that! We have to become so
assured of God's love, support and grace, that even the thought of dwelling
for a hundred millennia in our poor condition would not dissuade us in the
least. This is something to meditate on.

The "logic" you mention: I've also observed that divine knowledge tends to
pass in phases through us. First it informs the mind and our understanding;
then it transforms our vision and what we're able to see; then it affects the
heart and our sensibilities; and finally it manifests in our behavior and
reactions to the world. It can take a long time for wisdom to move from the
Writings on the page to this final step. I've been working on, "If they poison
your lives, sweeten their souls," my entire life.

Your desire to soar in the heavens of purity and chastity: that's who you
really are. Yes, the body weighs you down, but as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá said, "The
spiritual world bestows only the joy! If we suffer it is the outcome of
material things..." Strive to shift your self-identification to these
aspirations, the things that are conducive to joy. The rest is simply not who
you are: it's your momentary condition. And as your identity moves toward the
spiritual, you should find you cannot hate this because it is pure accident.
Let that hate become pity and then compassion, and finally mercy toward others
who also suffer from it. You are fighting the true Jihad now, and it calls for
warriors of outstanding resolve: not in the sense of strictness, but of
overflowing spirit.
