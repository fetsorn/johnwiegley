# While reading /r/zen and watching TV

Huang-Po writes:

> [The Tathagata] also said, "This Dharma is absolutely without distinctions,
  neither high nor low, and its name is Bodhi."

> It is pure Mind, which is the source of everything and which, whether
  appearing as sentient beings or as Buddhas, as the rivers and mountains of
  the world which has form, as that which is formless, or as penetrating the
  whole universe absolutely without distinctions, there being no such entities
  as selfness and otherness.

> This pure Mind, the source of everything, shines forever and on all with the
  brilliance of its own perfection. But the people of the world do not awaken
  to it, regarding only that which sees, hears, feels and knows as mind.
  Blinded by their own sight, hearing, feeling and knowing, they do not
  perceive the spiritual brilliance of the source-substance. If they would
  only eliminate all conceptual thought in a flash, that source-substance
  would manifest itself like the sun ascending through the void and
  illuminating the whole universe without hindrance or bounds.

> Therefore, if you students of the Way seek to progress through seeing,
  hearing, feeling and knowing, when you are deprived of your perceptions,
  your way to Mind will be cut off and you will find nowhere to enter. Only
  realize that, though real Mind is expressed in these perceptions it neither
  forms part of them nor is separate from them.

As I was sitting here, reading /u/ewk's comments, seeing others' reactions to
them, and my own reactions, I thought: What if /u/ewk were a bot? How would
that change my feelings? How would it change what I've felt until now? If he
were -- maybe even if he weren't -- aren't I really just reacting in myself?

Then I turned to the TV, watching a program, and realized: How it different
from the light coming in through the window, moving with the trees?

Then I looked around me, and saw the contents of my life as another program --
a bit more sensorily immersive, a bit more persistent in effect -- but in many
respects quite the same. What and why is my reaction?

# Letter of Resignation to LSA - Thoughts?

No Faith is easy to be a part of in its early days. Look at what happened to
the companions of Noah. It would have been almost impossible for anyone to
stay with Noah. Holding to a Manifestation of God during the time of awakening
is always difficult, and historically speaking, most people just don't. The
real numbers always come later, when we have grand churches, large communities
with established support systems, and commonly agreed upon doctrines.

To me, the community of today is an opportunity to serve, not to be served. I
can't expect it to be satisfying, fulfilling, or even easy most of the time.
We're scrambling to understand a Revelation that has never been seen before,
and its impact on current social systems is bound to be both damaging and
confusing, as old structures give ways to patterns of thinking outside our
present experience. In a way it's like giving birth: What happens in the
operating room is messy, smells awful, and is full of tension and even
screaming. It bears very little resemblance to what your experience of that
mother and child will be even a few weeks later, much less in the years to
come.

I think this question concerns the station of Bahá'u'lláh and the nature of
His Revelation. All else is secondary, even irrelevant. If I don't like some
of the laws, or if things seems illogical to me, then this is how I'm
experiencing the transformative effect of His Teachings:

    Know verily that the essence of justice and the source thereof are both
    embodied in the ordinances prescribed by Him Who is the Manifestation of the
    Self of God amongst men, if ye be of them that recognize this truth. He doth
    verily incarnate the highest, the infallible standard of justice unto all
    creation. Were His law to be such as to strike terror into the hearts of all
    that are in heaven and on earth, that law is naught but manifest justice. The
    fears and agitation which the revelation of this law provokes in men's hearts
    should indeed be likened to the cries of the suckling babe weaned from his
    mother's milk, if ye be of them that perceive. Were men to discover the
    motivating purpose of God's Revelation, they would assuredly cast away their
    fears, and, with hearts filled with gratitude, rejoice with exceeding
    gladness.

Or my favorite expression of this sentiment, from The Seven Valleys:

        When the qualities of the Ancient of Days stood revealed,
        Then the qualities of earthly things did Moses burn away.

    He who hath attained this station is sanctified from all that pertaineth to
    the world. Wherefore, if those who have come to the sea of His presence are
    found to possess none of the limited things of this perishable world, whether
    it be outer wealth or personal opinions, it mattereth not. For whatever the
    creatures have is limited by their own limits, and whatever the True One hath
    is sanctified therefrom; this utterance must be deeply pondered that its
    purport may be clear.

# Can you really be content?

I've seen some here who stress "contentment and bliss" in Zen, but I have to
think it's about being liberated from "content" vs. "not content". When you
have no issue with feeling what you feel, and nothing needs to change beyond
what the moment calls for, then what's the issue? It's not about constantly
riding a happy train; life is what you're in the middle of, right now and
always.

# Zen and Illusion

I don't think the Zen guys say the world is an illusion. If you suggested that
to them, I have a feeling you'd get a stick in the face, asking how an
illusion just bumped your nose.

What they might say is that the world you think you see is the illusion, and
exists as much as your dreams do: that is, having great effect on your
emotions and thoughts, but at the end of the night nothing has actually
changed.

# Question about progressive revelation and other religions

To use the school analogy: Although you move from one form of instruction to
another that builds on the previous, this doesn't mean you don't continue to
apply what was learned before. You just do it in the new context, where new
rules and problems are at hand.

# The problem of ZenNihilism in the community.

This is a good insight. My brain is almost entirely faith based at first. I
feel like someone who falls into the chair, and then sits as though I totally
meant to do that.

# Have you any Zen?

Someone here once asked me if I had anything that wasn’t Zen, and I’m still
reeling from that one. What is this “having”!

# Can zen solve completely insomnia and anxiety?

What Zen teaches me: Even if I worry about it, I can’t make worry last.

# Zen essence vs Zen periphery

    The principal activity of Zen is to penetrate through conceptualization and
    behold the pure mind devoid of all passions, attachments, objects.

This sounds so close to being totally on point and reasonable, but then I step
back and find so much in it that assumes I already know what it means:

Penetrate is given as a verb without defining the action to be taken; it
assumes a barrier, an actor, a place being penetrated to, but defines none of
them.

Behold: another great sounding word that seems like the main action, but adds
nothing.

The pure mind is...? Calling it pure doesn’t clarify what is meant by saying
mind. Or how it can be devoid; does it otherwise contain things?

Now I’m left with nothing at all, though it still sounds cool. I guess that’s
the beauty of conception for you.

A book is just paper and ink, but I have to go beyond that to reach its
meaning; still further to grasp the intent; and still further to understand
its animating principle. This last thing is wordless, and needed the whole
book to bridge the gap between my mind and that of its author.

I feel like some here are saying that Zen is just staring at the paper because
that’s what’s palpably in front of you. Though maybe it’s relating to the
principle — which cannot be prisoned even by intent — and leaving the book
behind once its task is achieved.

# Quote from Gleanings: "No man can obtain everlasting life, unless..."

Note that a person, even while alive and interacting with you, is reckoned in
scripture "as one dead" until he has recognized God. This doesn't mean he
doesn't exist, or isn't alive, or doesn't have a soul that might move on. But
there's life, and then there's life.

# Am I powerless?

The wave is powerless to step away from the ocean, and all his substance is
borrowed. It doesn't mean he doesn't move about, play and crash, only that he
has no existence separate from the sea, and should recognize this when
regarding it.

# Losing faith

Here's a story I haven't told many people before...

When I was a kid, I hated olives. With a passion. It boggled my mind that any
human being could derive pleasure from them, in any way.

Likewise, when I found the Faith, I hated religion. I couldn't say the word
"God" without a bad taste in my mouth. I couldn't pray. It took a full year
before I could even read the Writings, it was just too awkward and bizarre to
me.

Time passed, and one day, while reading Herodotus' History, I became so
affected by his absolute raving love of all things olive that I decided to try
them again. Peloponnesus green olives. OMG!!!! They were so amazing!! I would
buy them by the pound, and eat the entire pound in one sitting while reading
chapter after chapter of the History. I put olive oil in my hair, on my skin
-- I went olive crazy. Nowadays, olive oil is all I ever put on my salads.

So I asked God: Can you please make prayer be like the olives?

Wanting didn't make it happen. Hoping didn't make it happen. It took decades
of thinking and trying and experimenting. There is no silver bullet unless God
wills it; but there is a promise: that anyone who makes the effort and is
patient will find their answer.

> Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door
> will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives; he who seeks finds;
> and to him who knocks, the door will be opened.

> Which of you, if his son asks for bread, will give him a stone? Or if he
> asks for a fish, will give him a snake? So if you who are evil know how to
> give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven
> give good things to those who ask Him!

I wouldn't be discouraged if the path feels remote. If anything, you're
learning the true nature of the path by pushing through the brambles on the
side. The key, I think, is to strive for such patience, that even darkness
becomes a lesson about light. Where you are now is the perfect place to learn
about honesty, sincerity, purity of heart, and the attributes of a true
seeker. One who only thinks they've found, and mimicks all the right actions,
has yet to taste the sweetness that follows the bitter cup.

# Losing faith

I relate to most of what you've said, as can some of my close Bahá'í friends.
I think this is just real life: ups and downs, times when things are clearer,
times when they are more obscure.

Once I couldn't say the obligatory prayer for almost a year. It felt too fake
to be praying to God from a place of obligation. It took 22 years to resolve
this within myself, likely due to upbringing.

It's like a "dark night of the soul", where I seem to be wandering through
some wilderness in a daze. You can't invent faith, or will it to appear. I
think the essential honesty of our soul drives us away from living a sham life
for appearances. We only have so much energy before we return to where we're
really at, spiritually.

The only constant in all of this, the unbreakable cord, if you will, was to
hold on to my most favorite selections from Bahá'u'lláh. In fact, my last funk
was finally dispelled by savoring the syllables of this quote:

> O Son of Love! Thou art but one step away from the glorious heights above
> and from the celestial tree of love. Take thou one pace and with the next
> advance into the immortal realm and enter the pavilion of eternity. Give ear
> then to that which hath been revealed by the pen of glory.

Going back to the heart connection with the Source, that is what brought
everything else back into perspective. It's not about the laws, or the
religion, or the teaching or not teaching: it is about nearness to God. Once
that goal is firmly fixed, the rest becomes a means to that end, on both a
personal and a global scale. But imperfectly so, since we're growing and
learning.

I can't say much more than that. Find Bahá'u'lláh in your heart of hearts, and
blind your eyes to all things else.

# This could've been my faith, had I only known.

[posted]

As a lover of things mystical, I find there is an impossibly wide gulf between
our conceptions of God (which are always wrong) and our experience of God
(which is always mysterious). From this standpoint, even the word "God" does
us a disservice, since it lulls one into feeling we understand what we mean
when we say it.

In this respect, atheism is a kind of honesty: rejecting all concepts of the
Ocean based merely on second-hand reports, or one day's playing at the
seaside. Even the whales have seen only the briefest span of it.

So I applaud those who have come to such a point in their religious studies,
but would like to suggest that a new phase exists beyond it: a relationship
not based on knowledge or conceptions. Indeed, faith and death of self are
needed here, not rhetoric. "Be nothing then, and walk upon the waves." Which
may seem like madness in our intellectually-driven culture, but what is there
to be found is also profoundly real.

    The compass of the mind  
    is whatever it can conceive;  
    but the bound of the heart  
    is all that it believes.

# Is intellectual work compatible with zen?

I use the thinking mind every day for computer research. Just yesterday, at
one point I had to pace back and forth, grappling with a chain of reasoning,
feeling like my mind couldn't compute fast enough. Abstraction is a great
tool, and humans have ascendancy because of it.

I think where we run afoul is that we use the mind for two things. There's the
intended use -- why we have it -- and then there's using it for things that
are meaningless.

Imagine you had a knife and you kept cutting yourself with it because you
insisted on being careless. Does it mean the knife has no value? That you
shouldn't use it? That you should avoid knives? The knife isn't the problem,
but the user. It's even a great tool, so better to use it properly than to
discard it.

Applying the mind to convince ourselves that the unreal is worth paying
attention to: that's no fault of the mind itself. Poor guy, he's just
following our interests. So imagine what happens when you become fascinated by
what's actually there!

# Marriage: what to look for in constructing a Baha’i marriage and resources to help parents in the consent process

Having been through the ringer a few times, and talked to a lot of people and
observed a lot of married friends, I've come to feel that there's no real
guide that will tell you if two people are truly compatible or not.

There are a few basic principles I *think* I've learned:

- One of the greatest enemies to union is contempt. If one party thinks less
  of the other, or that they're somehow beneath them, or that they need to
  change or improve in order to become adequate, this will eat away at the
  connection like a termite over time. What is best is for each party to
  admire the other, likely for different things, so that you always feel lucky
  to be together.

- Anything that bothers you in the beginning will bother you throughout. Don't
  expect anything to change with time, but also don't expect everything to
  stay the same (most especially physical characteristics).

- Do not marry to escape loneliness! Another human being cannot supplant what
  God is meant to provide, although it may seem that they can for a time. Soon
  the hole will return, and it will erode your union as the frustration at
  feeling incomplete slowly transfers to resentment.

- Simply having a common goal, or a set of principles, is not enough, even if
  there are feelings of love. The best things to have are sincerity,
  pure-heartedness, quickness to forgive, and a constant eagerness to greet
  each new day together.
  
# Huángbò Xīyùn: Observe things as they are and don’t pay attention to other people

Mad houseplants are the worst. Sometimes, I look around my home and it feels

# How does one stop conceptual thinking?

This is a game you lose by playing, since "stopping" and "thinking" are just
more concepts used to modulate our experience of... whatever it is that we
are.

If you didn't have "red" and "blue", how many colors would there be? What
would be the difference between them?

"Stopping" isn't choosing between having such thoughts and not having them;
it's when even that distinction loses its grip.

These phrases mean nothing at all. They're magic words used to trigger
emotion. Not a single one has content.

Don't try to see dharma-nature. Reality is the one thing you don't need to
worry about. We imagine "as the water stills, the bottom becomes clear", but
this supposes a clouding agent between. The framing of this thought is the
problem!

> we see through to this dharma nature

You're seeing through something that doesn't exist? :-)

> As we move further along in our practice, we may come to a deeper
> understanding of the true nature of things and act accordingly

There is no deeper understanding. There's only what you have always been.
There is no you who's progressing through levels, accumulating wisdom,
gathering insight. The very idea of "deeper understanding" is what you're up
against. It's a delusion that only grows more subtle.

Reality abides unchanged, and nothing can affect it. Ideas of "progress"
pertain to the phenomena only, which are always changing and nothing can
preserve them.

I know you resonate with the ocean/waves metaphor. Tell me, how does a wave
dive deeper? How does it depart the ocean?

As someone who states "you do not exist", I find it surprising you would
assert the existence of delusion! This word "exist" is so pesky; it says so
little. :)

Truly, what is the point of Zen? Would we need it at all if we didn't have
this tendency to work ourselves into a state over nothing? We're like kids who
believe there's a monster under the bed. Is awakening to the fact that there
is no monster a profitable, worthy activity? Or is it a nonsensical activity,
made necessary by the maniacal insistence of the child?

A wave is a creature of zero thickness, zero depth. It neither dives nor
departs. As you've pointed out, it's "not really there", except as a moving
form given passing life by time. It has form due to the ocean, while the ocean
is the lone reality. All the wave has to do is stop asserting its existence,
or striving to regain companionship with the ocean. In a moment, there it is,
a tacit understanding, and all is settled with nothing achieved.

Yes! The question you just asked is more to the point than refined concepts of
reality or at-oneness. Feed that "person" a bitter pill it can't swallow, and
don't let it escape until the gears grind to a halt. Just watch, don't
ratiocinate. You won't stop playing the game if you think there's something to
be won; and you won't care to play, once you see "winning" for what it is.

# Linji tells me to be ordinary

There is no being special; it's simply not a thing. There is only thinking you
are special, and many of us work our whole lives to permit ourselves this
thought (that only we can grant, even if we need others to confirm it’s OK to
do so). It’s not that you shouldn’t desire it, to be ordinary or special. It
just isn’t there. Ordinary mind, in the sense of “just ordinary”, is a false
contrast. I think he means, “what’s there”, what is common to all.

# How do I become more humble?

What you are is never changing, and you can't put a finger on it. It can't be
humble, it can't be proud. It's only ever aware.

What you're aware of is always changing. You're aware of these emotions that
arise unbidden within you, and, using a matrix of societal norms, you give
them names and judge them good or bad, better or worse, etc.

Since before you could speak, this matrix has been layered onto you, to help
you fit in, help you become a productive and predictable member of society.
This is what the community does to survive. But you're none of these things,
and never have been. We don't choose our desires, our dispositions, our
reactions. So many of these things are probably just chemical, even though
they submit to a certain amount of control.

The error lies in identification, which gives rise to the emotional bind, and
then to baseless joy and sorrow. A roller-coaster of feelings that seem more
real than the air around you.

There is no "answer" to make this stop. Only see these things, watch them come
and go, get a feel for what your existence really is. What's left at the end
of the day, once all these emotions and reactions quiet down? What's different
tomorrow, or the next day? What stays the same?

In struggling to gain the upper hand and master such demons, we make the road
longer and more difficult. This is probably what brings about so much
frustration and agitation: the inability to control what is no more than a
vapor in the desert.

Whatever seems complex, layered, rich with distinctions, discard it. What you
call "you" is built up from so many tiny, illusory bricks; and even though we
weren't aware of it most of the time, we allowed every one to be fit into
place. The arguments we wage in our head? They aren't ours. The beliefs we
hold so dear? Not ours. The ideas, logic, the scaffolding of wisdom to help us
rationalize life? All borrowed.

What you really are is none of these. As you breathe, in and out: there, that.
It cannot be separated, and needs no joining. Only refrain from picking and
choosing.

This doesn't mean you won't feel rage anymore if somebody cuts you off the
road. Only, it should seem a curious thing, this reaction; and then, after
time has passed, more so, until almost amusing. The key lies not in what you
feel, but in really seeing it, feeling it fully, honestly, and then deciding
if you'll choose to own it, or let it be.

# Zen is the death of one's self

If you’ve been sitting in a dark cave, Zen is just getting up and walking out,
it’s not the death of the darkness. And when the sun hits your face outside,
that’s not the death of anything either.

Imagining an epic battle prolongs the farce. Turn off the movie, and you’ve
just been staring at a wall.

# Faith and critical thinking and our youth education

We are teaching them, and ourselves, to rely on forces outside our
understanding, control, or observation.

Human logic is sharply limited: it can only verify the truth of statements
phrased in that same logic. The distinction between "model" and "reality" is
obvious, but subtle. It's like a group of people in a cartographer's shop,
believing they're traveling the world...

Life will always contain mysterious elements that refuse to submit to reason,
such as love, inspiration, confidence, etc. These things are far more affected
by faith, than by what you can understand about them in the mind.

We are like cups, able to sample the water of the Deep at any point, but never
more than that at a time, and never the whole sea -- no matter how much time
we have. Our souls, on the other hand, swim far and free, whales of an
unyielding sea, singing songs far beyond our hearing.

# How does one practice the Baha'i faith in daily life?

Be loving, loyal, truthful and kind, to more than just those who know you. Act
so that your deeds contribute to the advancement of civilization. Enjoy your
friendships and family, and spread that cheer to others. Be humble, and always
avoid becoming a cause of conflict.

This basic pattern hasn't changed in many thousands of years, unless you meant
the laws, of which the daily ones are: reading the Writings morning and night,
saying the obligatory prayer, and soon, keeping the Fast in March.

# What religious types agree on is the real nihilism

What does religion have to do with it? That dichotomy is pushed by a few on
this channel, apropos of nothing. What you’re describing is human behavior, of
any stripe.

A nihilism that negates false conceptions is what it’s all about, to awaken
you. Once these conceptions are gone, nihilism is no longer a meaningful way
to approach reality. Quite the opposite: “just suchness” is pure positivism,
without contrast.

People chewing pages from a cookbook to satisfy their hunger is enough to
exasperate anyone. Don’t imagine it’s the failing of only one group, or one
point of view.

# Religion teacher trying to understand the Baha'i Faith

I'm not sure we try to reconcile each religion's later institutionalized
beliefs with their associated Manifestation of God.

That is, we believe in the divine origin of Christ as a Messenger from God,
and the Bible as the spirit of His Teachings, but this doesn't mean we take on
the burden of reconciling later Christianity (and its many christologies) with
Christ Himself. For example, you can google for "did Christ believe He was
God", and see debates between learned Christians on whether He did or didn't
think or say this.

In Bahá’í thought, Chris is both God, in relation to humanity, and is not God,
in relation to God's Unknowable Essence.

For Buddhism, it's hard to know exactly how much of Buddha's exact words are
captured in the centuries-later writings we have. That they evince the spirit
of Buddha's message is without a doubt, given their continued efficacy. But
what do "God" and "self" and "rebirth" really mean? Did those ideas become
overtly flavored by a cultural background that sought to re-explain the
concepts in a doctrinal context?

For example, if you read the Kitáb-i-Íqán's description of the true seeker,
and how he must purify himself before being capable of recognizing God -- and
then squint a bit -- several of the Buddhists ideas about "self" and "God"
(i.e., the God of our conceptions) begin to line up quite nicely. The Íqán
evens goes into some depth on the ideas of "life", "death", "rebirth" and
"resurrection", which make it sound like it's not the ideas the Manifestations
ever disagreed on, but humanity's misunderstanding of those conceptions.

# A few questions by TheLongRoadTo in r/bahai

Hi Long Road,

 1. The Manifestations of God have human form, but their Spirit is that of the
    Ancient Beauty. They exist in a condition that you and I cannot achieve,
    not as just "humans with a message". Note that this differs from how
    Judaism, Christianity and Islam all regard their Prophets.

 2. I'm afraid this question would require quite a bit of research, so I'll
    defer to others.

 3. We don't try to reconcile it with modern standards of morality, but if you
    compare it to the world it was born into, it would seem very modern
    indeed.

 4. You only truly appreciate what you earn.
 
It’s a good question, and one without a simple answer. Bahá’u’lláh says that a
debt unpaid in this life must still be honored in the next, though the form of
repayment will be magnified due to the change in circumstance. A murderer who
pays with his life (either way) has redeemed himself, and will not be punished
twice. As Plato once argued, a man who knows the truth would long to expiate
his crimes in the name of justice.

Our modern society, with its materialistic bent, has placed enormous stock in
the prolongation of physical life and the enhancement of pleasure and comfort
over pain. But these are neither spiritual, nor aspiritual. The law of God
should be judged by its effect on the common spirit of man, and each
individual person, rather than how it matches up with a worldly agenda. And
sometimes, this process is long and slow, allowing man to make his mistakes
along the way (such as no previous Manifestation outlawing slavery, which is
among the greatest horrors to the modern mind).

I think the “proper context” is simply too big to conceive, which is why I’m
grateful for the Universal House of Justice. Perhaps life imprisonment is the
intended punishment, just as it was written that we could have two wives, when
only one was meant.

Sure, I first encountered this idea in Adib Taherzadeh's Revelation of
Bahá'u'lláh, Volume 3:

> From a careful study of the Writings of Bahá'u'lláh one may reach the
> surprising conclusion that just punishments in general, and those ordained
> in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas in particular, are a mercy of God to man, and a token
> of His loving-kindness to him. Bahá'u'lláh in one of His Tablets[20] reveals
> some of the mysteries of this life and the next, describes how everything in
> this mortal world has counterparts in the spiritual worlds, and explains
> that the individual's deeds in this life will affect his existence in the
> next. To illustrate the benefits which will accrue to the soul, if he is
> punished in this world for his misdeeds, He uses the example of a man who
> steals a seed of a tree from someone in the spring season. If he returns it
> to its owner in that same season, he has cleared his debt and does not owe
> him anything else. But if he fails to give it back in the spring, what does
> he owe him in the summer? He owes him a tree and its fruits, because to give
> back the seed in the summer is useless. This analogy explains that if the
> individual pays for his misdeeds in this life by receiving the punishment
> which is ordained in the Holy Writings, his burden of sin will be far
> lighter in the next life. Otherwise, who knows how heavily his soul will
> have to pay if he somehow avoids punishment in this world.

The above footnote [20] says this comes from Má'idiy-i-Ásamání, vol. 7, pp.
119-25, which is the Lawh-i-Haqqu'n-Nás: "Tablet of the Rights of the People".
A provisional translation of this tablet is available.

There is also the following quote from Selections from the Writings of
`Abdu'l-Bahá, #152:

> As to the question regarding the soul of a murderer, and what his punishment
> would be, the answer given was that the murderer must expiate his crime:
> that is, if they put the murderer to death, his death is his atonement for
> his crime, and following the death, God in His justice will impose no second
> penalty upon him, for divine justice would not allow this.

# Do zen masters offer any practical advice beyond (possibly) badly translated mind puzzles?

Here's some inferred advice: A large part of what people spend their lives on
is spinning their wheels, turning the crank on an emotional machine to no end
but that. When this is done with, you have the whole day in front of you.

Just tasting food, breathing, can be quite an experience, when there's nothing
to compare it to.

# God's mind in a timeless existence

Not a description of God, a thought experiment:

Pure potential never changes, containing all possibilities. We're the actual,
wondering about the existence of potential-not-actualizing.

For us, actualization is existence. But for pure potential, is it a relevant
question?

# Once again. Nothing exists?

bamboo swings
green eyes widen
the crack of dawn

# I'm scared of going to hell but I just can't belive in god.

Have you ever looked at Sufism as another way of seeing the Qur'án?

Some views of religion look at this world as unique in nature: a place where
one may just as likely believe in God as disbelieve in Him. That is, nothing
here compels one to believe or not. Love of God must happen through faith, and
there will never be conclusive confirmation of that faith.

This opportunity never returns after death, and it's a tremendous loss not to
seize it. In such a view, the allegory of hell -- depicted quite graphically
in the Qur'án -- is an attempt to install in people the seriousness of the
matter, so that the benefit of this life may not be taken lightly. Hell is not
a physical place with horrible torments, but your own knowledge of what has
escaped you. If this seems mild in comparison, you aren't thinking big enough
about what this is all about.

Or from another perspective: the next world is invisible, inaccessible.
Virtuous conduct trains the soul for entry in that world, yet the imperatives
of physical life are constantly in conflict. How does one communicate the
extreme importance of such training, when materialism at all times so
thoroughly dominates our attention?

So, I think "living in fear of hell" misses the point and is too
self-oriented.

Here's a Bahá'í quote emphasizing the other side of the coin:

> Such is the station ordained for the true believer that if to an extent
> smaller than a needle's eye the glory of that station were to be unveiled to
> mankind, every beholder would be consumed away in his longing to attain it.

# Zen Patriarch Jayata embarrasses Buddhist monks and converts their leader

> "I just curbed you, in front of your followers," continued the Master to
> 'Everywhere Active', "did you attain to the state of not fretting about
> that, in your heart of hearts?"

Brilliant.

# Timeless Intelligence

I agree with you. God, the Infinite, cannot be placed within finite
conceptions.

We constantly anthropomorphize God — I at least understand why the Christians
do — but God the Father is unlike anything we’ve ever known; so how can our
stories contain Him? I think the Holy Books express the attributes of God, as
manifested in the world, but they do nothing to reach His Essence.

# Am "I" not my brain?

Perhaps the issue is that because we haven't specifically located the self, it
only exists as an idea, which is to say, a conception. What happens when
conceptual thinking is stopped? The self disappears, and all you're left with
is the condition of awareness. Then why talk about self at all? Awareness is
self-evident without need of conceptions: it manifestly is. Even if self were
something I could be aware of, it would still have no special status, unless
it were more fundamental than awareness itself.

But awareness seems to be "groundless", or rooted in the void. Conceptually
speaking -- and this is where I enter the wilderness of error without a guide
-- I like Sartre's conception of Being-for-itself the best:

> Being-in-itself is concrete, lacks the ability to change, and is unaware of
> itself. Being-for-itself is conscious of its own consciousness but is also
> incomplete. For Sartre, this undefined, nondetermined nature is what defines
> man. Since the for-itself (like man) lacks a predetermined essence, it is
> forced to create itself from nothingness. For Sartre, nothingness is the
> defining characteristic of the for-itself.

Such a nondetermined nothingness recalls Huang Po:

> Mind is like the void in which there is no confusion or evil, as when the
> sun wheels through it shining upon the four corners of the world. For, when
> the sun rises and illuminates the whole earth, the void gains not in
> brilliance; and, when the sun sets, the void does not darken. The phenomena
> of light and dark alternate with each other, but the nature of the void
> remains unchanged.

...

> Without some point of reference, how is awareness possible?

This is really the place to "enter in", as they say. How indeed!

As for Sartre's incompleteness, I believe the idea is that awareness exists
through being aware of something other. That is, it does not exist
independently from the ongoing experience that is its existence. It is neither
"self-sufficient" nor "complete". Being-in-itself, on the other hand, subsists
without awareness and depends on nothing external, but as such has no
consciousness.

Sartre also spends some time questioning the root of awareness -- the point of
reference you ask about -- since that inner quest is precisely the existential
crisis of the For-itself. That is, the For-itself is aware of its own process
of awareness, but can never find "that which is aware", only the experience of
an experience, and an experience of that experience, ad infinitum.

Thanks for the engaging questions; I hang out in /r/zen because few people
elsewhere wonder about these basic points without promptly relegating them to
mere terminology.

# Why is freedom of religion ok but freedom from religion is wrong?

You can’t stop people from having attitudes like this, so sadly our
commiseration here won’t help at all

No founder of any Faith I’m aware of advocated compelling or pressuring others
to believe. The Qur’án says it quite plainly in 2:256: “There shall be no
compulsion in [acceptance of] the religion.”

If God is love, and love can only be given by the heart freely, I’ve never
understood why anyone would try to force the issue.

# Will god judge the mentally ill

This judging is carried out with justice, which means each receiving what they
deserve according to God. I take this to imply that a person is not held
responsible for actions they don't fully understand, the same as it is with
conventional law.

# Yuanwu says you need more than books, you need a teacher.

> This is why we need a valid scientific reality theory, since not every smart
> person will receive the true transmission.

Give a monkey with a banana a shiny new mirror: He no longer wants to eat the
banana, he wants the other one.

# After everyone has their delusion dropped and enlightenment is realized, what then?

You choose what you will do next, not crediting the choice to some
accumulating concept of self, or fearing/desiring the impact on "you" and
"your life". The basis of choice becomes much simpler: what is called for?

Note that if this seems boring, unfulfilling, or without much of an aim,
there's something in that to be noticed.

# Is the Creator compatible with Zen?

I think so. Zen cuts through the layers of absurdity blinding your view of
reality; it doesn't say much about that reality, however, for the obvious
reason that doing so is often the thickest of those layers.

# Why it is important to marry a partner of like disposition?

Because after the marriage has happened, you'll be spending most days with
them for potentially several decades. That time is much more pleasant if you
can talk freely with your partner, appreciate similar things, and generally
never run out of joyful things to do together.

# What Wansong Just Forgot to Mention

Mysticism is a pretty poorly defined word, but to me, the Four Statements of
Zen in the sidebar are pretty much what I think of as being mystical. Not the
magic/spirit/voodoo type of mysticism, but the "sudden, immediate, outside the
teachings, direct experience" type. That is, as opposed to gradual,
structural, practice-based and following prescribed rituals and hierarchies.

# Not sure what “religion”/belief structure I currently have - help?!

If I were you, I'd try not having a religion at all for a while, just your
thoughts and beliefs. Then study, reflect, try things out, see what speaks to
you. You're in an awesome place right now, of openness and sensitivity. No
reason to stuff yourself into the nearest box with a similar shape.

I've enjoyed the Bahá'í Faith, which has led me to believe that God desires
for hearts to approach him freely, not from any positive or negative
compulsion.

If you were looking for a friend, someone who would be true and have faith in
you no matter what, would you want them to do it because they feared you, or
were seeking advantage, or thought it made them look good, or did it to copy
others, or from ignorance, not knowing who you were? I think you'd want
something genuine, as we all do.

So, better than identifying your best match for a religion, clarify in your
heart what you really want, why you're seeking faith. Know yourself,
understand your motives, and then you can offer yourself to the Beloved
wholeheartedly when you find Him.

# Is "design" a self-evident aspect of the universe?

Even as a theist, who agrees with the design argument, I don't find it meets
the standards of inarguable proof.

Science currently has reason to believe that universal contraction and
expansion have been ongoing for an unknown amount of time. Consider the sheer
variety of the universe: statistics alone means there is a lot, and I mean a
whole lot, of exploration of possibilities going on. Basically, whatever can
happen, will happen.

We observe what we observe. The fact we're observing it doesn't make it
special, just that we exist in one of those rare statistical outcomes where
such observation can occur. We see what we see because it's there to be seen.

This is basically the million monkeys argument: Give a million monkeys
typewriters and unlimited time, and they will eventually reproduce all the
written works of humanity. This doesn't make a single one of them an author.

Now you could ask, "Who created the matrix of possibility itself, from which
all this variety arises?" In the case of the monkeys, it's whoever gave them
the typewriters; in the case of the universe...?

...

> But I fall back to atheism when I realize there's no reason to believe why a
> God would do such a thing. There's nothing to influence God to do anything
> if nothing exists at all...

Maybe another thing to question is: what is existence? Is it the physical
objects we see around, whose seeming permanence depends entirely on time? I
too would wonder why an infinite God would bother investing His attention in
something so transient.

But perhaps real existence, what religion is calling us to recognize and
engage with, is something other: like a flower growing in the dirt, it
requires this morass of ignorance and blindness for the truth to become
obvious. Perhaps what God has done is subtle, befitting His reality, and it is
the journey of the soul to ultimately experience the joy of appreciating it.
And perhaps this was done from love, and no other reason.

# Will you be accepted into heaven even if you hate god?

If you really hate God, then I'd say whatever you think of as "God" isn't even
close. It would be like hating your best friend: you can only do that when you
fail to recognize who they are.

That isn't to say we often fail to understand God's plan. We'd really don't
have the full picture. But this is what faith is about: trusting in who
someone is, even when their actions go against our expectations and
preconceptions.

# Why Zen Masters always trying to tell wise things when they are not?

As a thought experiment, imagine all your life you were perfectly blind and
uneducated, kept in a room. Suddenly, a cloak is pulled off your head and
there you sit, in a dark room, in front of a perfect mirror which is slanted
toward you. There's a hole in the ceiling. The sun is shining through it, onto
the mirror, and right into your eyes.

You hear someone say: This is the sun. This is not the sun. It is both the sun
and not the sun. It is neither "not the sun" nor "not not the sun". What is
that person trying to say?

# Is Buddhism's message really that negative?

I think it can be seen as negative because we're on the side of the illusory
world of self and duality (samsara), and Buddha's message of awakening implies
an end to this dream world. Trapped within illusion, what we call "life",
we're basically stretching ourselves out on a rack of anxiety and pain due to
our expectations, beliefs, viewpoint, etc. There's nothing redeeming in this
self-delusion, and real peace is only possible once it ends.

It's like receiving a message within a dream that you have to wake up:
observing such a message from the perspective of the dream is quite different
than if you reflect on it after waking.

I'm not a Buddhist, but this concept of "self/delusion" being "hellish" and
"awakening/awareness" being "heavenly" has many parallels in the Bahá’í
conceptions of these two worlds.

# Dilemma on purpose of life

I hear you. When seen as a “hurry up and wait” existence, it's a very hollow
life. I think we’re brought up to see things this way, in cultures where
religion is about heaven and hell, since the great merit of life is presented
as escaping from one and gaining access to the other.

But this isn’t how it is. Give yourself the freedom to rethink your concept of
God, of nearness, of Presence, of the Manifestation, of Revelation. There is
SO much more to be found, nearer than your life's vein. And then, realizing
these truths in the context of service, since even the healthiest lung is only
so if it breathes...

# The true meaning of "ordinary existence", aka the famous "drawing water and chopping wood"

I think desire is as normal as wanting food, or enjoying sleep, or hankering
for a cookie.

Grasping is not letting such things come and go, but holding on (or
rejecting), trying to fix life into a pattern, making ideas primary.

It’s not about being egoless or emotionless or without humanity; it’s just not
adding, and not taking away.

...

Guarantee? Why would I need be sure of a future behavior? Isn't that what
holding onto an idea is about?

If I want a cookie, I either get one or I don't. If I don't, there may be a
lingering impluse. This is my body at work, that's what it does. Holding to an
idea of saintliness where I never want things that are tasty seems to me to be
the real problem.

I do get frustrated, I get sad when nice things that I own are destroyed or
stolen, I want cookies. These come and go, while Mind is changed by none of
them. It's only my wish for things to be a certain way -- good or bad -- that
spoils the day, because then I'm focusing my attention on things that just
have no result.

I think Christ nailed this one:

> Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for
> itself. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble....

> And which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to his span of life?
> If then you are not able to do as small a thing as that, why are you anxious
> about the rest?

I looked for a relevant quote from Huang Po on this, but will OP it rather
than pasting here.

...

I think we attach to ideas, and try to force these ideas on life, primarily
from fear that if we don't gain some measure of control over who we are and
what's around us, it'll devolve into a nightmare from which we can't escape.
Desiring is one thing, even plants desire water; the idealized object of
fulfillment we attach to is another.

At the same time, trying "not" to do this is equally impossible. The only
escape is pure, simple recognition: that there is nothing to be controlled,
and no control to achieve. We ourselves setup the hurdle we're unable to jump
over. There's nothing hard here that requires a unique and rare human being --
which I'm not, you wouldn't be able to pick me out from a crowd. It's seeing
that we create the maze we're running through. We're the ones setting the bar
one notch too high, and the end one step too far.

# an uncomfortable problem

I think "addressing porn" is as effective as approaching detachment by talking
about "the problems of attachment". Some people's brains are wired that way,
and it will help them, but it's fundamentally a negative perspective (getting
someone to stop doing a harmful thing) rather than a positive one.

The novel education here is the innate nobility of human beings, and that
chastity -- in all its dimensions -- is a powerful component of that nobility.
This is quite different from centuries of past moral education that have
assumed people are basically evil and constantly need redemption/saving.
Purity is purposive, it engenders spiritual sensitivity, permits us to connect
with our lives in exalted ways, and frees us from distraction to pursue more
subtile realities.

We have to give young people a higher aim, a better goal, than scaring them
with how harmful the dangers of the world can be. It reminds me of anti-drugs
commercials on TV that actually saw a rise in drug use afterward, because they
led to many more youth thinking about taking drugs than it did to preventing
their use.

...

My apologies if linking your suggestions to puritanism was off-putting, that
wasn't my intent. It was just a first reaction, something I feel any time an
issue begins with discussing with what not to do, or what damage has been
done. For example, a group of people can discuss racism all day long and make
little progress; but if we deepen on the equality and nobility of man, it
upraises everyone.

I'm not sure most young people will listen if you tell them about all the harm
porn can do, because either they're already doing it and won't listen because
they're ashamed, or they aren't doing it and might just think, "I won't fall
into that trap, what will a little hurt". But if we dwell on higher things,
you can develop that focus and build on it, attach all the Revelation of God
to it, and then not engaging in porn has both a purpose and a clear
justification, apart from just being harmful.

# Misconceptions about Enlightenment: It gives you happiness as we know it

Not sure if these were part of the untruths you mentioned, but:

All matter is energy; and even the least divisible part is in constant motion.

Stillness is purely an illusion, since it depends on the scale of the
observation in both time and space. See things at the smallest level, and the
universe is an absolute chaotic blur of potentials and possibilities.

We look at a mountain and think: solid, stable. But step back in time, or
forward in space, and it becomes like a passing cloud.

# What does seeing your true nature mean?

If you had asked, “what does being in love mean?”, I assure you every answer,
however true, would not be an answer.

The meaning of seeing your true nature is only: seeing your true nature. Every
word beyond this is smoke, not fire.

# Are there any applicable real world examples/benefits that a "Normie" such as myself could take away from zen?

I like the question! Depending on how you approach it, it could do more harm
than good, so I wouldn’t recommend it for “benefits”. When you get tired of
running on the hamster wheel of your own mind in search of a state you’ll
never reach, though, and crave a little destruction to end the madness, check
back.

# How does one become a Baha'i exactly?

A follower of the Bahá'í Faith -- someone who self-identifies as a Bahá'í and
is recognized as such by the governing bodies of the Bahá'í administration --
is someone who:

  - believes in the claim of Bahá'u'lláh: that He is a divinely-ordained
    representative of God's will on earth;
  - agrees to observe Bahá'í laws to the extent of his or her ability;
  - accepts that authority to manage the affairs of the Faith was passed from
    Bahá'u'lláh to His eldest son, thence to His great grandson, and afterward
    to the international governing body of the Faith, the Universal House of
    Justice.

These are the only "requirements for membership". Beyond this there are
certain laws, relatively few in number, as well as several principles and
duties to be observed. Among the necessary laws are:

  - fasting each spring, if capable;
  - obligatory prayer, said once daily;
  - reading and writing the Words of God each morning and evening;
  - payment of the Huqúq'u'lláh (a form of tithing);
  - making pilgrimage at least once (though obligatory only for men);
  - certain others.

Among the principles of the Faith, we should regard:

  - all human beings as equal in the sight of God, without prejudice or
    favoritism;
  - service to humanity as fundamental to happiness and prosperity;
  - education as essential to developing human character;
  - the laws of one's prevailing government as obligatory, except where they
    conflict with Bahá'í laws;
  - the counsel of a component physician as having significant weight;
  - and the religions of the past as intrinsically linked with our own.

The entire moral code of the Faith is rather extensive, but mostly it centers
on the extreme potential of humanity, and that the purpose of God has been to
develop this potential both materially and spiritually, in order to ready
humanity for the collective realization of its unity.

A person who serves others as though they are serving God: if any sentence can
define what it means to be a Bahá'í, I think it would be this.

# Do you ever get clues?

Your question suggests there is a wrong path, or someplace that is not on your
way, or in the flow of things. But the goal is not "here" instead of
"elsewhere", or along one way instead of another; it's rather this very
questioning and where it arises from that is the gap.

If someone believes they're in a prison, then they're a prisoner; but if they
ask you how to escape, what do you say?

# What are we talking about

Avoiding all the dark places is no way to find the sun.

Experts in what isn't zen can't help you. If meditation causes you to look up,
then do that.

# One Thing

The wind blows, and all the pines trees hiss and whistle. Is it the wind
speaking? the trees complaining? my ears yelling in my skull? Who is silenced
when the wind stops?

# Are religious tales meant to be taken literally?

In Bahá’í thought, the allegorical nature of these stories is not only
affirmed, but given a purpose: to determine who is willing to read the holy
scriptures with insight, and who would put them to their own use. Bahá’u’lláh
wrote:

> Know verily that the purpose underlying all these symbolic terms and
> abstruse allusions, which emanate from the Revealers of God's holy Cause,
> hath been to test and prove the peoples of the world; that thereby the earth
> of the pure and illuminated hearts may be known from the perishable and

# Got Enlightened, Got Certified AMA

I'd agree. The monk's very thought is the foundation of the world, Mt. Sumeru.
I wonder what the OP saw.

# Values

I don't think they were ignorant of justice. Grain belongs on the table,
manure in the garden. Like and dislike separate things according to the mind;
eating what the body actually wants is spontaneous.

We mistreat others due to blindness. Looking upon a fellow infinite, we see
only a small shape, but it's our limitation we see.

Is it indifferent to cease categorizing according to likes and dislikes? To
take things as they are in relation to you at each moment? That's not "null
affect", it's rising when wakeful, sleeping when tired. You're responding to
what's in front of you, not a mental standard applied without sensitivity. "I
hate blueberry pie". Have you tried every blueberry pie, at every moment it
could be tried? That's being indifferent to reality.

# [Vaguely Zen] Mountain

Indeed. As you say, "an event". Once the event is past, isn't the adept likely
to forget it, since one event apart from others is not reality?

# [Vaguely Zen] Mountain

I wouldn't say that's what Zen is about. As the Wikipedia page on kensho says:

> Kenshō is an initial insight or awakening, not full Buddhahood. It is to be
> followed by further training to deepen this insight, and learn to express it
> in daily life.

I see Zen as relating more to a life lived without delusion, not an experience
that bridges between.

# [Vaguely Zen] Mountain

And sometimes, a person talks and talks, but a passing wind says more. Other
times, silence speaks louder than words. Travel to both sides of your
mountain, then inside and outside, upside and downside, how far did you go?

# Not true mind

Without air, the lungs could not bellow, even though they'll never grasp the
sky. Without true mind we couldn't ask these questions, so, never hidden, just
not seen.

# help^4

Look straight ahead of you, around you. You are where you have always been,
only the appearances have changed. The remembered past cannot affect this, nor
the imagined future. There is no "me", only this awareness. Any larger concept
of "me" is a mental overlay on a singular experience, obscuring its nature.

Liberation is just that: not beholden to the past, nothing offered from the
future. You think it will be good or bad, but by and large it will be as
things are now, only the sensations altered. This is why things are never
quite as bad as you'd feared, and never quite as good as you'd hoped. Reality
isn't dialed to 11 like our imagination of it.

The loss of your father is real, no doubt. He was there, now he is gone. What
pains you is constantly re-losing him in the mind, over and over again. In
time this will abate, but if you grasp the mechanism you can find the root of
suffering.

Your shoulder's pain: that's the body telling you to act. Do act on that. It
could be a growth or foreign body impinging on a nerve, or as harmless as a
cyst or damaged tendon or mineral deficiency causing a complication. The body
is naturally wise -- it has nothing to gain from deception -- so when it gives
counsel, heed it.

# The lines is Zen garden

I like that sand is made to imitate water, in a medium entirely opposite the
nature of water. Zen monks juxtaposing illusion as art.

# Correct and Incorrect Seeking

Seeking strengthens the belief that there is a something to be sought apart
from the seeker. I think Rumi put it most beautifully:

>    Love is a veil betwixt the lover and the loved one.  
>    More than this I am not permitted to tell.

Ask everyone you meet about the nature of silence; if you don't find it, ask
more, ask louder!

# Teaching about the Bible in American Public Schools: Legal or Not?

I think it's one thing to teach what the Bible says, but often people want to
teach what it means (mainly, to the teacher).

For example, there's a lot less problem teaching Greek mythology, because we
don't insist on establishing its relevance to people's lives.

/u/tetracot's point is that philosophers do not agree on the validity of such
a question. What does it mean for a thing to be “true”? Truth is not a quality
of objects, but anything that can be said within the meta theory. Intuitionism
in particular does not see a binding connection between human logic and
existential reality. The former is only a system of reasoning; it does not
reveal fundamental details about the latter.

If such disagreements are already known to exist on these basic points, we’ve
lost the common notion of “true” that was posited earlier.

# How to become more Conscientious?

While being conscientious is a noble trait, I think that, like virtue, it
cannot be achieved as an end in itself. When virtue runs counter to natural
tendencies, it is not only exhausting but a constant source of failure.

The key is love of God. When that's the motive, virtue becomes a means to an
end: the same way you'd want to become more physically fit if you found a
sport you adore. Virtue enables the soul to aim higher; it engenders finer
susceptibilities. Yet the Goal is all, for when you arrive at that highest
point, even the self who had wished for it will be no more:

> How can a true lover continue to exist when once the effulgent glories of

> his Creator will be such that, were he to search the East and the West, and
> traverse land, sea, mountain and plain, he would find no trace of his own

# Robes, and Buddhist virtue signalling
                                   
I've noticed this pattern too, in quite general contexts. For example, when
someone describes a movie/song/cuisine/place they like, and you get a sense
that what they like most is the thought of being the sort of person who would
like that thing. I.e., who they are vs. who they want to see themselves to be.

People "take on robes" in this sense not just religiously, but when it comes
to exercise, vegetarianism, a new author, language, art, etc. They become
evangelicals because they've "found themselves", along with a sudden surge of
energy, freedom, awareness, creativity. Freed from the prison of some old
self, the new self appears as a boundless adventure.

But perhaps the only real "putting on of robes" must be a shedding of old
ones: To discover what you like, even if at first you don't like that you like
it; to see the complete foolishness of one's life so far, without a wise
replacement; to feel cut off and adrift, because you really are in uncharted
new territory.

I've often been critical when tasting the saccharin sweetness of such beliefs.
It's why I disliked hipsters so much: sheep following the cult of "unique
individualism", trying so hard to avoid the appearance of trying. In the end,
such critiques are but an effort to smash the mirror of reality, to not see my
own tattered "robes" gathering around me.

Real truth remains such a baffling mystery that when we finally seek to escape
the chaos, our surrogate self is necessarily just a puppet, wrapped over a
spasming hand.

# Serious question! How is Islam the right religion?

If you're questioning the "rightness" of a religion based on later accuracy of
its scripture in the hands of the faithful, this is going to rule out a lot,
depending on whose evidence you ask for.

Muslims believe Jewish and Christian scriptures were modified; Christians
believe the same thing about the Qur'án, while declaring for their own book
Biblical inerrancy. Which is historical accurate? It depends on whom you ask.

I take this to mean that the correctness of a religion is not founded on its
material exactitude, but rather its spiritual aptness for the time it appeared
in, and whether it was capable of fulfilling the promises it made to its
generation. The way the Arabs thrived after the Qur'án was received, is, to
me, a more compelling argument than historical textual analysis.

# What is reality?

Imagine you visit a map-maker and ask, “What is England?” The only way for him
to give a right answer is to kick you out the door.

Reality never needs thinking about, it’s like asking, “Am I awake?” Any answer
we can offer in words — including these — is already too much, obscuring.

# Reason-Religion vs Right Understanding

This pattern feels familiar:

 1. Pick some concept that's sufficiently abstract and all-encompassing: mind,
    intellect, understanding.

 2. Pick a verb-oriented concept that's equally so: awareness, enlightenment,
    awakening, detachment.

 3. Claim that by connecting the two, happiness and peace result.

Though it always depends on terms that are never fully defined and only
perceptible to the very thing being liberated...

None of this seems like Zen to me. Burn these houses down.

# what is it all about?

You are the answer, pursing a question. The foolishness is not endemic, just
situational comedy.

# Sometimes when I'm under stress, I talk to deities even though I know that they don't exist.

Part of us feels a need to make sense of things, but within an incredibly
limited and time-impaired perspective. Another part is vast and linked to
unknown things, but cannot express itself, except through deep and insensible
urges.

But you're quite right, no one else can find it. Fare well!

# what is it all about?

All this talk of enlightenment, it makes things worse.

Zen isn't worth your time; it discards this value! If the only achievement
reads, "stopped playing the fool", do you still want it?

# Sometimes when I'm under stress, I talk to deities even though I know that they don't exist.

Maybe you're using symbols to establish a safe relationship between conscious
and unconscious, in order to relieve internal tension. You've picked the idea
of foreign gods as your symbols, where others may have picked a mandala or a
cross or a star in the sky or prayer.

Symbols, according to Jung, derive their power because they make sense both to
the conscious mind (they have a concrete representation and offer a point of
focus) and the unconscious (they have no definite meaning and so can be
interpreted freely). He speaks at length on this subject in his book, "The
Psychology of Types".

# concerning spirituality

I think a lot of new age literature works up the idea of enlightenment into a
magical, unique experience, to demonstrate the great value of those who
"achieve" it. And since it's so special and wondrous, it can't possibly be
related to ordinary life unless you're some kind of saint.

But everyday life, the mundane and frustrating, is a better place to look for
what you're after, since at least it's free of this false mystique. Meditation
is good for paying attention -- to the mind and its follies -- but
tranquillity alone is just another temporary state.

When everything is what it is, and you stop trying to tell things what they
are, the plainness of it all may seem quite wonderful on its own.

# Zazen really resonates with me, but in every day life I lose awareness

There seems to be a popular association between "awareness", and being totally
peaceful and blissed out. I don't think awareness has anything to do with
condition. All that there is is awareness.

The problem arises when we ask "who is aware?" as if there were something
else, separate and independent, after which everything is seen as separate and
independent. This only muddies what is otherwise absurdly simple.

# Posting in subreddits of other religions

I comment in /r/zen, and now /r/zens and sometimes /r/religion.

I'm very interested in how other faiths approach the aspects of religion they
care most about: for example, Buddhists dig deeply into the illusion of self,
which has been incredibly helpful in understanding the Bahá’í/Sufi concept of
"annihilation"; Christians excel at wanting to develop a personal relationship
with the Holy Spirit based on faith and scriptural foundation; Muslims have
really keyed into the significance and power of the Revelation of God; and
Judaism is well-known for its regard for the Law of God.

Most of the time, I just want to know more about these faiths, and to offer
whatever I can that will help us both go further in these journeys -- based on
perspectives offered by the Bahá’í Writings. After all, this is a collectively
human endeavor, and not an "us" and "them" affair.

When it becomes appropriate, I'll mention that these insights come from our
Faith, or connect the inquiry to the Faith, but the motive is not to try and
work things around to mentioning the Faith. The majority of the time I never
bring it up at all, until it seems both relevant and meaningful.

One thing I've learned about participating on reddit is that no one wins any
arguments. Talking here is not going to change anyone's heart, unless the
person you're talking to feels that you've fully understood their point of
view, you care about what they're looking for, and you've given sincere
thought to answering questions they actually asked. Then you can offer a word
that will open doors. But any argumentation at all is a lose/lose proposition,
no matter how crazy and insulting other people may become. How you respond to
people, and what you choose to respond to, seems to be far more important.

# (catholicism) guilt advise

Just as fear of pain should keep you from doing stupid things, but not make
you terrified of living your life, fear of God should help protect you from
harming yourself spiritually, but not lead to anxious guilt. Doing the right
thing is about helping you, not God. A violinist doesn't tune his instrument
just because someone told him that he should.

As an individual, you need to make up your own mind about weed and its
religious connotations. I would say that God cares about YOU, and how getting
high could interfere with your aims in life. The same way your parents do.

# Agnostic here, looking for a new perspective.

Anyone who's convinced that they're right is wrong: they just haven't realized
how limited human knowledge and understanding are yet. Infinity doesn't fit
into finite conceptions.

What isn't wrong is loving Christ and wanting to fulfill His dream for
humanity. I'd love it if there were more humility in conveying the message,
but you have to give it to your girlfriend that faith isn't about being right,
but qualities of the heart.

On the question of whether there's "one right way", I think the scientific
method gives the best result: put it to the test. A good tree bears good
fruit, or it's fit for the fire. Compare the goal to the outcome. Does the
Christian church make good Christians? What is a good Christian? These might
be better to ask than to debate the logical foundations of a heart-based
belief.

# the bitch god

Is the question really, "Why didn't God make life so easy that we'd never have
to learn how to really be human beings?" Because if you gave us a perfect
world where nothing bad ever happened, I'm pretty sure that wouldn't lead to
much maturity on our part. Just look at any rich child who's never had to
suffer at all for a reference.

# Proceed on from the top of the pole

Maybe it can be asked in other terms: How can you proceed further along the
Path, after all the thoughts and opinions you've formed about life? Wearing a
sackcloth hood, aware of the shadows beyond, yet years of intensifying
concentration and honing imagination have not resolved them. How do you go
further?

# Questions about belief

To offer another perspective: I know the Bahá’í Faith is a religion, and often
understood as a religion: A unified system of beliefs and practices, a common
core of scripture and fellowship, and a mission to serve the world driven by a
guiding organization.

However, on the mystical side of things it's foremost a connection to the
Manifestation of God, a Being Who is ultimately a Perfect Mystery. We may ask
ourselves whether the laws of the Faith make sense, or if we agree with them,
or what their purpose might be; but in the end, the only thing we really know
is that Bahá’u’lláh asked us to follow them.

I think about this when I say the Greatest Name 95 times a night, because when
it comes down to it, what do we have to offer God, Who is absolutely infinite
in every respect? What we can do, He can do better; we don't know anything
unknown to Him; and what we call excellence, in thought or deed, are to Him
the ways of children.

Yet, He's asked us for these things. Not because He needs them, yet He asked.
In a way, it sort of doesn't matter what's been asked -- just by asking, He's
given us an opportunity to know something He wants!

Most of the time I don't know why, and my explanations are shallow compared to
the mysteries of Revelation. If sometimes it's OK to eat pork, and other times
not, how will I ever know the reason behind it?

I bring this up because, while it's perfectly OK for you to choose your own
beliefs -- this is our essential freedom -- consider what it means. It's not
about what makes sense, or what you agree with, or what has a meaningful
outcome. You've been asked. If you believe in the Person of Bahá’u’lláh, and
Whom He represents: you've been asked.

# Devoid of conceptual nature

To offer another opinion: When seeking Mind, even seeking is wrong, because
there is neither seeker nor sought. Looking for it creates the journey;
pondering it gives birth to the universe.

# Seeing your nature is Zen

When I open my eyes in the morning, I may feel delicious in that moment, but
staying there until nighttime isn't desirable...

I personally don't think stasis is our goal, but a relationship to change that
unifies experience. Emotional satisfaction is fleeting and fragile; show me
someone who smiles when they drink the cup of anguish -- because for them, it
is a strange joy -- and I'll be impressed.

# Bahá'í opinion on Scientology

Although we ask for donations from Bahá'ís, we never ask if you've donated.

Interpreting the Writings, except for very few instances, is up to you. We
don't believe that indoctrination will help you grow spiritually.

We believe in succeeding both in this world and the next: excellence is sought
in every facet of life, and not in opposition to anything but turpitude.

It is a continual journey of love toward a Being Whom we believe your soul has
longed for since its first motivations.

# How do I hear back from God?

I've found the biggest challenge of the mystical journey to be that our belief
crafts the world we experience. I don't mean that thinking "rock" is what
makes you stub your foot, but when you look down and think "rock", that's when
it becomes a rock that stubbed you.

We look at the world, and see so many things, but how many of the things we
see are what we told ourselves they would or should be?

At the heart of all that moves and turns, there is something never changing
even as it always changes. Through the multitude of experiences we've had in
our lives, beneath it all there is one experience, playing itself out over and
over again, wondering if we will ever see the stillness for the motion.

I believe you already heard back from God before I wrote this. But it likely
wasn't, and never will be, in a form you expect. It's remote enough from
expectation, in fact, that you might someday despair it will ever come.

I think God is exactly as close to us as we think He is. We're the ones with
limits; not Him.

# Difficulties Reciting Daily 95 Allah'u'Abhas

One more thing perhaps: When we recite any words from the Revelation of God,
there is a part of what happens we're aware of: understanding, insight,
knowledge, awareness of our deeds, etc.; and a much greater part we only dimly
perceive, if at all: the breezes of divine holiness.

What makes these Words significant is not the words themselves, but that they
were revealed by the Manifestation, and invested by Him with specific power,
made binding on us in the form of Law. So there is a special grace from
obedience to that command, which serves to "unlock" the potential He placed
there, if our obedience arises from sincere devotion.

The mind is a horse's eye, whose perspective is terribly limited by the
blinders of our finite self. At the same time, we are told to charge headlong
toward the infinite horizon. Clearly, what we see (or understand) as we do so
is the least part of the journey, even though it too is quite beautiful and
powerful.

Every word of the Revelation, when recited with purity of motive and humble
obedience, bathes the soul in light, and sets in motion unseen forces that
change reality around us. Having faith in this process, and shifting our focus
to the dynamics of the Hidden, is part of what I see this recitation training
us to do.

# Bahá'í beliefs

Bahá’u’lláh is not bound by the beliefs of the Christian theologians, anymore
than a Christian should feel bound by the beliefs of the Pharisees. There is
no requirement to reconcile their interpretations of scripture with Truth.

So you know, we also have a notion that man is "inherently sinful", in that
human beings naturally incline toward their material apetites and illusions if
left without spiritual education. We too emphasize that without the redemptive
grace of the Manifestation of God, and holding to His teachings, man cannot
free himself from sin by his own efforts or through good works alone. The
Manifestation is an essential figure in the operation of man's spiritual life.
St. Paul makes this clear as well, linking freedom from sin with acceptance of
Christ's gift. However, rather than using this to emphasize the role of Christ
in our spiritual lives, many have placed undue emphasis on the sinfulness of
man, and that we must loathe and abhor our nature. This is not something
Christ taught, and Romans 5:12-23 makes no mention of it, preaching instead
the message of freedom from sin through Christ.

If you make the assumption that Bahá’ís must reconcile their scripture with
the Christian churches of today in order to claim true prophethood for
Bahá’u’lláh, there will never be an end to questions like these.

> It is clear and evident that whenever the Manifestations of Holiness were
  revealed, the divines of their day have hindered the people from attaining
  unto the way of truth. To this testify the records of all the scriptures and
  heavenly books. Not one Prophet of God was made manifest Who did not fall a
  victim to the relentless hate, to the denunciation, denial, and execration
  of the clerics of His day! Woe unto them for the iniquities their hands have
  formerly wrought! Woe unto them for that which they are now doing! What
  veils of glory more grievous than these embodiments of error! By the
  righteousness of God! to pierce such veils is the mightiest of all acts, and
  to rend them asunder the most meritorious of all deeds! May God assist us
  and assist you, O concourse of the Spirit! that perchance ye may in the time
  of His Manifestation be graciously aided to perform such deeds, and may in
  His days attain unto the Presence of God.

The person then asks:

> I can see this. However, then upon what standard do we judge whether or not
  someone has come from God? How can I tell whether or not Bahá’u’lláh is who
  is says he is? If all I have to work with is the beliefs I currently hold
  and a bunch of stuff about him, but none of it seems to work together, what
  am I to do, if he is, in fact, who he says he is?

This is a wonderfully formulated question, and really is the essential one.
How can we know?

I think you have to read what's available, from every source, apply it to your
life, consult your heart, and pay attention to the effect these teachings have
on yourself and others you meet. Anything from God should have a result beyond
mere words and ideas, though it may take a little while to recognize it.

Although we carry in our heads our own standards of truth, discovering real
truth must involve abandoning that personal standard at some point. Otherwise,
would could not learn anything truly new, since it would not fit our
preconceptions. This is as much true in science as anything else. The trick is
how and when to discard what we know for something new. Are we being deceived?
Am I throwing away truth for delusion? Or the opposite?

Stay sharp, purge your heart from every attachment, and pay attention to
what's happening around you. I trust in your humanity that at some point, what
is true will begin to illuminate the background.

# How is this justified???

Something to keep in mind when reading any Holy Book is that it is both
instructive, and a test of mankind to discern the pure in heart from the
deceivers.

In verses like this, given the time at which they were revealed, God made
women socially, legally and financially inferior to men, a choice that would
influence the later social order -- for whatever reason it was needed at the
time.

But those who use the text for their own selfish reasons, read this as women
being intrinsically, essentially, and spiritually inferior. Which, of course,
there is no reason to assume.

For another example, consider the verse on women's testimony. This may have
been to safeguard the one being witnessed against, rather than an assessment
of women, since women were largely uneducated and this could have resulted in
chance misunderstandings. The Qur'án does say (though I rarely hear this
quoted):

> 3:194-195 "Our Lord! Give us what Thou hast promised us through Thy
> messengers, and disgrace us not on the Day of Resurrection. Truly Thou wilt
> not fail the tryst." So their Lord answered them, “I shall not let the work
> of any worker among you, male or female, be in vain; each of you is like the
> other....

The legal status of women should not be read as a measure of their inherent
worth, since in the sight of God, they are alike spiritually. However, their
status on this earth was most certainly not (yet) made equal, even though men
were commanded to protect women:

> 4:34 Men are the upholders and maintainers of women by virtue of that in
> which God has favored some of them above others and by virtue of their
> spending from their wealth. Therefore the righteous women are devoutly
> obedient, guarding in [their husbands'] absence what God has guarded. As for
> those from whom you fear discord and animosity, admonish them, then leave
> them in their beds, then strike them. Then if they obey you, seek not a way
> against them.

Again, contrast this with the humanity of the time: when girl children were
being buried alive, and women were not considered human beings. If the goal of
the Qur'án was to educate mankind, to promote unity, and to prepare
civilization for the next Manifestation of God, it needed to advance the
people to the degree they were capable.

# How do you interpret Acts 1:11 in the Bible?

> “They also said, "Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into the sky?
> This Jesus, who has been taken up from you into heaven, will come in just

Hi /u/iapst,

I can see from your posting history that you like to tackle the hard questions
head on, both here and in the Christian forums. Well done.

For a more meaningful discussion with Bahá’ís on Christian subjects, we should
recognize that we agree on some things without reservation, even if we do not
share every belief. The Universal House of Justice writes:

> As to the position of Christianity, let it be stated without any hesitation
  or equivocation that its divine origin is unconditionally acknowledged, that
  the Sonship and Divinity of Jesus Christ are fearlessly asserted, that the
  divine inspiration of the Gospel is fully recognized, that the reality of
  the mystery of the Immaculacy of the Virgin Mary is confessed, and the
  primacy of Peter, the Prince of the Apostles, is upheld and defended...
  
Note here the term "divine inspiration" rather than a literal and historically
faithful representation of the events of those days.
    
For example, related to the question you posed,
consider
[this Christian article](http://davidgpeterson.com/acts/resurrection-and-luke-acts/).
In it, the author examines Luke's motivation for emphasizing the physical
resurrection the way he does in both Luke and Acts. His thesis is that the
author was explicating Christ's fulfillment of the Messianic hope of the
Pharisees in terms they would find unmistakable. To quote an excerpt:

> ... Luke believed that the hope of the resurrection could be 'a shared
  starting point with some Jews.' By way of contrast, pagans are pictured in
  Acts as reacting negatively to preaching about a bodily resurrection.

[Some historians believe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorship_of_Luke%E2%80%93Acts) that
Luke himself did not write these texts, but another author *who, being human,
had his own agenda* relayed the story, making it possible that it gained
certain elements toward an intended effect on its hearers. It may have gone
from a teaching about Christ's ascendancy after His resurrection, to a
physicalization of those events to make a subtle point more clear. I would not
even call this a misrepresentation during an age when miracles and divine
portents
[were commonly used](https://infidels.org/library/modern/richard_carrier/kooks.html) to
assert the greatness of a person. Rather, it may have been a way of
strengthening the author's theme: that Christ had risen again, and His church
would conquer the Romans and restore the nation of Israel, in fulfillment of
Messianic prophecy.

I recognize that many Christians would outright deny this idea, and I have no
argument against that denial. I'm only suggesting a possible reading of the
Bible, if we permit the assumption that it is not 100% historically accurate.
I'm sure you wouldn't expect a discussion with a Jewish person to go very far
if they insisted you accept their interpretation of Messaniac prophecy, as
taught to them in their synagogue. People of the day converted to Christianity
*because they were willing to read the Torah differently*. The fact that we
ask the same of Muslims and Christians is no different from any other past
religion.

So, there certainly exists a Christian viewpoint where you're totally right:
the statements in Luke/Acts are obvious and literal, and it makes no sense
that the Bahá'í Faith would claim the Bible is correct while denying a
physical ressurection. However, for the Bahá'í answer to this question, we
believe the Bible has been unsealed in this day and its true meaning laid bare
by the Pen of Bahá'u'lláh. He has told us, in multiple places, that the
"resurrection" is an ancient, spiritual theme applicable to every one of the
Prophets of God -- even to the believers and deniers who appear with every
Manifestation. The biblical story of Christ's resurrection made the fact of
His resurrection plain using a physical representation of events, but the real
truth of the matter is of the spirit, not the body.

You can
find
[many Bahá'í quotations](http://www.bahaiquotes.com/quotepage.php?Quotes%2FResurrection+) concerning
this point, but I'd like to offer just one, from `Abdu'l-Bahá:

> The resurrections of the Divine Manifestations are not of the body. All
> their states, their conditions, their acts, the things they have
> established, their teachings, their expressions, their parables, and their
> instructions have a spiritual and divine signification, and have no
> connection with material things.

There
[is also a letter](http://bahai-library.com/uhj_resurrection_return_jesus)
from the research department of the Universal House of Justice, specifically
on this question of the Resurrection and Return of Jesus.

I leave you with the words of Paul himself:

> There are heavenly bodies and earthly bodies, but the glory of the heavenly
  is of one kind, and the glory of the earthly is of another. There is one
  glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the
  stars; for star differs from star in glory. So is it with the resurrection
  of the dead. What is sown is perishable; what is raised is imperishable. It
  is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness; it is
  raised in power. It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body.

Peace.

# Good and Evil at the End

I wonder if an analogy might apply: While our bodies are developing in the
womb, it's possible for some parts to develop poorly, just as others do well.
Then we have to live out this life with those weaknesses and strengths. In
that sense, some parts of our body afterward might be described as physically
heavenly, and others as hellish.

I know many religions are boolean in their view of heaven and hell: either
you're in one or the other. But perhaps the degree of virtue we achieve in
this life is like developing a healthy soul, which is able to thrive in
another world intended for its nature. We may even be able to keep developing
once this life is past, but just like development here: however much we can
still accomplish amazing things, whether deaf or disabled or blind, we can't
change what we start with after the developmental stage is done.

# Why do the Central Figures get to reinterpret the Bible and the Qur'an in new ways that hadn't been done before them?

/u/The_Goa_Force makes the point: the Books are sealed, and the Manifestation
opens them in the Day of His Resurrection. This is also referred to as the
"sealed, choice Wine".

Why are they sealed in the first place? Because the books do not just convey
spiritual understanding, they are also a test to those who read them:

> Know verily that the purpose underlying all these symbolic terms and
  abstruse allusions, which emanate from the Revealers of God's holy Cause,
  hath been to test and prove the peoples of the world; that thereby the earth
  of the pure and illuminated hearts may be known from the perishable and
  barren soil. From time immemorial such hath been the way of God amidst His
  creatures, and to this testify the records of the sacred books.

Could He have been more obvious? Certainly. In fact, He could have made
everything clear as day with a single word:

> Within the treasury of Our Wisdom there lieth unrevealed a knowledge, one
  word of which, if we chose to divulge it to mankind, would cause every human
  being to recognize the Manifestation of God and to acknowledge His
  omniscience, would enable every one to discover the secrets of all the
  sciences, and to attain so high a station as to find himself wholly
  independent of all past and future learning.

This points at a Divine purpose behind the sealing of the books, and there is
more going on than just education of the people.

# Christianity and Buddhism

I'm not sure if "Buddhists don't believe in God" is entirely accurate...

From what I understand -- though I'm not a Buddhist -- Buddhism rejects any
and all conceptions of mind as an interface to True Reality. Instead, we are
one with that reality, but willfully fail to see this due to various
illusions: a separation that leads to suffering. Only by becoming free from
self can one experience the truth and reach nirvana.

What is the character of True Reality? Is it God? Is it not God? I'm not sure
Buddhism even addresses this. What I've read is much more directed at freeing
the individual from his prison of self, than trying to explain -- in terms
that would only tighten the lock on that prison -- something that mind/self
has no hope of ever comprehending.

So I'd say that Buddhists don't believe in God, as in the conception "God"
that makes us think we can talk about "God" and be talking about anything
meaningful. But if by God you're just pointing (without understanding) to that
Reality which the prison mind is part of while still not seeing it, then sure,
God is as good a word as any, and to some extent the descriptions even match
up.

One dimension that Christians and other theists add to the word "God" is the
idea that He directly intervenes in the affairs of mankind. I'm not sure I've
met a Buddhist yet who would say that Divine Reality would do this, as if it
had a human-like persona.

Another way to describe this difference is to say that Buddha emphasized
experiencing Reality through freedom and enlightenment, rather than theorizing
about Reality through study and contemplation. Since God can't be experienced
(infinite vs. finite), He necessarily will not be found as a subject of this
experiential doctrine.

# In a comment

Love needs a veil to exist, otherwise the heart could not withstand the beauty
of the true Beloved: it would become devotion itself, without choice. "Love is
a veil betwixt the lover and the Loved One".

# Every person creates his own reality

What this idea seems to be lacking is that even if I do create my own reality,
other people still have to live with it, and their own creative efforts often
have little impact on mine.

Yet, also in support of this idea, from
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kathy-gottberg/the-truth-behind-you-get-_b_6780858.html:

> While the exact phrase, "you create your own reality" may have come from
  Jane Roberts back in the 1970s, others have expressed similar ideas for
  several millennia. The Buddha said, "What you dwell upon you become."
  Jesus said, "It is done unto you as you believe." Hindu mysticism from
  Shankaracharya says, "Whatever a person's mind dwells on intensely and
  with firm resolve, that is exactly what he becomes." It says in the
  Talmud, "We do not see things as they are, we see them as we are."

# I have a hard time believing in the God I was raised to believe

I think many of us are taught to view God as a power player in what is
principally a human drama -- something that makes little sense, if you think
about it. Why would God develop feelings of antipathy toward us just because
we're weak and ignorant and always still learning? Faith isn't obvious: it can
take a lifetime to develop, and *not* having faith is even sometimes part of
that journey (e.g., the Apostle Paul himself).

I wouldn't worry so much about what you've done, or what you think God will do
in response. He's a better friend/parent/confidant than we can ever give Him
credit for. Instead, focus on your own heart, and whether it is sincere and
pure. I'm not even talking about a need to believe right now. Just purify and
cleanse your heart as best you can, and find out from there what will move you
along on your journey.

As for the Old Testament God: Much of the Hebrew bible does not quote a
Prophet giving revelation that such and such a thing happened. What we know is
only what has come down to us as stories in these books.

For example, the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah: let's assume the cities
existed, that they were destroyed, and that the people who lived in them were
as morally corrupt as the Bible says. Now some natural disaster occurs that
seems like a freak occurrence, as we know does happen. It's easy to imagine
that the God-fearing people of the time, seeing the immorality of those
Sodomites, would believe their destruction was a just retribution. They would
say "it was from God", and really who would argue with that? Even today we
might say the same thing, if a particularly evil person gets his comeuppance
through a freak event, an "act of God".

It's therefore highly likely that, as a record of the times and a striking
moral example, it would be written down for future generations to observe and
reflect on. This doesn't necessarily mean this was Revelation, though, or that
it accurately portrays what God was thinking and feeling.

Different readers of the Bible will have different interpretations, of course,
and some who hold to the entire Bible as the infallible Word of God will think
it means exactly what it says. But perhaps the point of the Torah here, being
divinely inspired, was to provide the spiritual lessons humanity needed to
move forward in their progress as a nation. That is: *these are human focused
stories*, meant to educate us along the Right Path, rather than accurate
indicators of the personality of an Infinite and Unknowable Being, by Whose
Own Revelation in the later words of Christ is all goodness, love and mercy.

# Confused and In Search: Please Give Me Your Best Ideas

As you approach the philosophical God, keep in mind the limitations of the one
doing the seeking: However much we may love a pet cat, for example, and even
if they understand physically what's going on when we move them from one
apartment to another, they'll never understand our motivations or reasons for
doing so.

Most of the uses of the word "God", to me, have nothing to do with the Reality
we're discussing now. At best they serve as mystical placeholders, or points
of reference; but they are not and cannot be definitional in any way, because
that would presuppose a frame of reference greater than God, within which He
could be defined.

# A Question about the Relationship Between the Reformed Interpretation of Soteriology in Christianity and the Bahá’í Faith

I think the difficulty lies in the statement "this is really what the Bible
says". Questions like the ones you listed have been debated among Christians
for centuries, so to assume a particular interpretation of the Bible is in any
way obvious or conclusive is nearly impossible, given that no authoritative
interpreter exists to tell us what the Bible truly meant.

On this sub we can tell you what the Bahá’í Writings say about the meanings of
various passages, or we can talk about what Christian denominations have
believed, or what different groups within Islám have to say, but we cannot
entertain a conclusive discussion about "what it means", because frankly, I
have no idea, and no way of knowing even if I did.

I believe the Bible is holy, inspired by God, and constitutes an expression of
Divine will. This is a matter of faith, not history or science. And I believe
that anyone who sincerely seeks God by applying its verses to their lives may
find divine grace will reward their efforts.

So, I would love to dive into the Bible deeper with you. In fact, I've been
reading the NT again lately (ESV, this time), along with a Yale course on the
history of the New Testament. But debating the correctness of theological
views... I'm afraid that has never ever led to anything positive, if history
is any indicator.

# Having serious trouble reconciling our Baha'i 'mission', as outlined by Shoghi Effendi, to defend what I view as a redundant ideology

Unless I'm mistaken, I see several questions being asked in your OP:

 - Why are we being asked to uphold Islám, if its social teachings are not relevant for today?

 - Since we have a new standard, and a new Revelation, why should we look to
   what has gone before, or feel the need to address it?

 - How can we uphold the divine beauty of the Qur'án, when it contains so many
   seemingly harsh verses?

I'd like to offer some thoughts on just the third question for now, since the
other two represent whole discussions of their own.

----

How do we, as lovers of the Ancient Beauty, come to recognize the gem-like
beauty of the Qur'án, as an emanation from His Exalted Pen?

> Number me not with them who read Thy words and fail to find Thy hidden gift
  which, as decreed by Thee, is contained therein, and which quickeneth the
  souls of Thy creatures and the hearts of Thy servants. -- Bahá'u'lláh

You made the point that the Qur'án is outdated -- and in its moral and legal
teachings, it certainly is. If that weren't the case, God would not have sent
another Revelation. However, in its spiritual teachings, the Truths enshrined
within it remain unchanged. This is evidenced by how frequently Bahá'u'lláh
quotes from it to explain fundamental spiritual principles.

Defending Islám and the Qur'án does not mean justifying its practices in the
context of today's society. It means upholding its value and role in human
history, while preserving those eternal aspects that will never be eclipsed.

The Qur'án speaks often of fear, the fire, and God's wrathful vengeance; but
this is no ordinary fear, or fire, as it has been preached to the masses. That
fear is something you would cherish in your heart as a dear possession, and a
guarantor of victory -- as you might honor wisdom as a safeguard for
knowledge; and that fire is nothing other than unbelief itself, into which the
infidels are cast by their willful disobedience; and God's wrath is likewise
the harsh light of truth, as much as the Earth's, if you were to ignore the
laws of gravity and throw yourself from a great height.

Words like these have spiritual meanings that are greatly obscured by literal,
humanistic interpretations, that imagine God as some powerful, earthly-minded
king Who imposes whatever laws He wishes, while punishing the disobedient.
However, the beauty of Qur'án is not to be found in this view. Hold foremost
in your mind the goodness, love, and mercy of God, and then read His verses as
if there could be no other interpretation.

For example, in verse 2:59, we find a pretty scary statement:

> ... So We sent down a torment from Heaven upon those who did wrong for the
  iniquity they committed.

The word used here for torment is rijz, which is also translated as
"defilement" (or sometimes, evil whisperings) in verse 8:11:

> Behold, He covered you with sleepiness, security from Him, and sent down
  upon you water from the sky to purify you thereby, to remove the defilement
  of Satan from you, to fortify your hearts, and to make firm your steps
  thereby.

These "evil-whisperings of Satan" portray the promptings of the insistent
self, that inclines people toward evil. Thus, the "torment" sent down on those
who do wrong is to leave them to themselves! Compare this to a similar
statement from the Báb:

> Indeed shouldst Thou desire to confer blessing upon a servant Thou wouldst
  blot out from the realm of his heart every mention or disposition except
  Thine Own mention; and shouldst Thou ordain evil for a servant by reason of
  that which his hands have unjustly wrought before Thy face, Thou wouldst
  test him with the benefits of this world and of the next that he might
  become preoccupied therewith and forget Thy remembrance.

Rather than fire and brimstone, divine torment here is described as material
benefit and the promises of the next world! How opposite to any literal
reading of the Qur'ánic verse!

Similarly, many of the dreadful passage from the Qur'án can be understood in
another light: not as vengeful acts of an angry God, but conditions of spirit
whose ultimate effect is so horrible, that for some, only the literal message
conveys the intended meaning.

# Any former atheists here? What's your story?

I was brought up a Christian (though very liberal), and became an atheist when
I turned 14. I was a pretty rabid atheist too, and disliked all religions
quite intensely. Later I became an agnostic, since it seemed presumptuous to
be so certain about something I could not verify either way.

So why am I a Bahá’í? It was not because of something I learned or experienced
that was unavailable to me before. What it boiled down to was that Bahá’u’lláh
made a claim I felt compelled, as a lover of truth, to verify.

With most human authors, bogusness can be detected pretty early on. Even if it
seems rosy from the start, inconsistencies begin to pop up here and there.
After my first discussions with a Bahá’í I had met, there were surprisingly
few of these, so I asked for a book to intensify my study, looking for the
hole that would unravel the lie behind the beautiful sentiments.

The religious side of my journey, especially the relationship with God, did
not happen until much, much later. I would say that my first religious
experiences did not occur until 12 years after this study began, and I was
unable to genuinely appreciate prayer for more than 20 years. All this, even
though I declared as a Bahá’í 11 days after discovering it: not because I was
certain it was true, but because I wanted to continue my exploration "from the
inside".

So can I offer any words that will prompt you to faith? I don't think so. What
I would suggest is, rather than focusing on abstract concepts like "faith",
"soul" and "God" that humans may never resolve, focus on the concrete matter
of Bahá’u’lláh's life and declaration, and whether you see the divine in His
words and teachings. That is how I finally noticed God, after ideas and belief
alone could not get me there.

# Feeling lost, need some help

I think the Christian attitude toward this is very helpful, from 1 Timothy
1:15:

> The saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance, that Christ
  Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the foremost.

Religion is not sent for those who barely need it. The power of God is borne
out in the transformation of those who, it seemed, were almost lost.

# The Bahá’í Faith, for the most part, seems pretty great, but...

To give you another perspective: I've been in this Faith for 26 years now, and
have held many institutional positions in that time: assistant, assembly
chairperson, treasurer, cluster development facilitator, ATC secretary, Ruhi
tutor (many times over), etc.; you can fairly say I've drunk the cool-aid.

So with much experience I tell you: I adore our Universal House of Justice.
When you consider the scope and difficulty of their decision making process,
and how many different cultures and peoples it affects, it is amazing they
progress as smoothly as they do. And their letters... my God, their letters...
it's like mother's milk poured directly into the heart.

It's very easy to cast the seeds of doubt, but only ignorance will allow them
to take root. If these matters trouble you, then do not become a Baha'i today,
but spend your time with these people and determine for yourself if they are
delusional or sincere. Justice requires that you "see with thine own eyes, and
not through the eyes of another."

Let me know what you find; for my part, I continue to be happy to throw in my
lot with these beautiful souls.

# What is the gate through which I need to passthrough, to become enlightened?

I think there is no gate to pass through. The "gateless barrier" is awareness
itself. It is a barrier because the untrained mind thinks of "he who is aware"
and "what he is aware of"; it is gateless because there is nothing to pass
through, nothing to gain, any more than we can become rich by dreaming. We can
only awaken to the fact that there is no barrier but our own sight: no passing
through, no traveler, no destination. Only the sun, the moon, and nothing in
between.

# Koan of a dead cat's head

The koan distinguishes between value as a property of things-in-themselves --
the common belief -- and value as an attribution applied by the mind.

Since no one associates value with the head of a dead cat, it becomes
"priceless". This points at the ludicrous nature of applied value judgments,
and turns the student's view of the world on its head.

In other words, asking the question proves he does not see
things-in-themselves, so the master throws him a curveball that doesn't fit
his conception of "what has meaning". It's a monkey-wrench in the works, and
is meant to cause discomfort leading to realization. The use of a dead cat's
head has shock value -- coming from a revered master -- meant to intensify
this effect.

# What is the point of Bahai?

If all books lead to knowledge, what's the point of new ones? :)

God is infinite, and every Prophet reveals a fuller measure of His glory and
mystery. They all lead to the same Placeless Place, but each Messenger has
more to teach us about that destination as we evolve.

# Do Baha'i consider Sharia law a legitimate form of governance?

I think that, without changing the root of the problem, even if you fight
corruption and win, the winners will be gradually be replaced by more who are
corrupt. Until hearts are changed, all peace is temporary, and any appearance
of justice is transient. The battle against injustice must be won on the field
of hearts, not policy or media sentiment or popular opinion.

> See then how wide is the difference between material civilization and
  divine. With force and punishments, material civilization seeketh to
  restrain the people from mischief, from inflicting harm on society and
  committing crimes. But in a divine civilization, the individual is so
  conditioned that with no fear of punishment, he shunneth the perpetration of
  crimes, seeth the crime itself as the severest of torments, and with
  alacrity and joy, setteth himself to acquiring the virtues of humankind, to
  furthering human progress, and to spreading light across the world. --
  ‘Abdu’l-Bahá

# Please teach me how I can lose anger quickly?

Not saying it's easy, but: You're always angry at "something", and that
something never really exists. No one stays angry at a physical object, but
what that object means to them -- and we define this meaning, whether we're
aware we do it or not.

I believe there can also be physical anger and irritation, but this is quick
to fade. It's the anger we "hold on to" that you probably meant.

Rather than trying to control the anger, find the origin of what you're really
angry about, even if it takes hard work to discover. It's the ludicrous nature
of this anger that makes it ultimately disappear, not because you become a
better person, or engage mental acrobatics, or find ways to eliminate it.
It'll disappear suddenly, on its own, once you see that it's basically the
same of being angry at a mad face painted on a balloon.

# I miss my dad today.

I don't think missing your father is unnatural, because if he were here, you
could be doing things with him. If I have a screw, but no screwdriver, I'd
miss the tool; recognizing the absence of something isn't "just mind".

The thing to contemplate is your sadness at the fact, and where that feeling
arises from. In addition to being sad, you have strong desires: that it should
never have taken place, that it was wrong, unfair, unjust. These desires fuel
your awareness of his absence as a deeply painful thing. Yet if you'd been
brought up in a society where adults naturally took their lives at a certain
age, as an honored and celebrated practice, you might still miss him, but be
proud or even happy. Same circumstances, different response.

Similarly, the taste of vanilla won't change overnight, and it's natural for
the body to desire some flavors more than others. This is part of how animals
survive in the wild, by following their cravings. Granted, the makers of ice
cream abuse this by giving us sugar and fat mixed together, but the root of
the preference is still in the body. Greed arises when you don't want it to
end, or wish other things were vanilla, or begin to taste everything in
comparison to vanilla.

So I don't think it's the total absence of loss or enjoyment that you're
looking for, but freedom from how your desires bind you to them. You'd think
from reading this sub that the enlightened ones is are robots; I've seen
people claim one should have no emotions, thoughts, ideas, or varieties of
experience... I don't think that's it. If a free man happens to eat the same
food as a man in prison, the world of difference isn't found in the diet.

# Struggling

There is no "division between selves". The inner self you see is the same as
your petty self, and every other "self": reflections on a rain drop. Now
splashing onto the ground, they scatter, but the water is still unchanged.

Inner harmony or unity is not the answer; see that the drama of disunity
playing in your mind is something you're telling yourself exists -- and you
believe it so completely! How strange.

# Spot the Error: Lungya's Sharp Sword

I wonder that too. Although I recognize when no-sword cuts no-neck, and
no-answer speaks no-word, I have yet to feel the bite of steel on my nape.

You ask for words and I choke; you ask for no words and I gasp for air.
Between the two, I can't find my face with both hands.

# Spot the Error: Lungya's Sharp Sword

Lungya posed a fanciful question, and Deshan played along. Dongshan posed a
fanciful question, and Lungya failed to play along. The error was thinking
that the first scenario was fantasy, but the second was real.

# What do you do with these contradictions between Christianity and the Baha'i Faith?

> First off, before the objection is raised that the scriptures of
  Christianity have been corrupted, I want to go ahead and dispel that as best
  I can. The New Testament, which is the main focus of Christian doctrines and
  ideas, has been preserved quite well.

We agree with you that the Bible is the divine foundation of the church of
Christ; [CARM](https://carm.org/quran-says-bible-not-corrupt) even agrees that
the Qur'án teaches this as well. So, no argument on this point.

I recommend [this course](http://oyc.yale.edu/religious-studies/rlst-152) from
Yale University on the historicity of the New Testament. It's interesting to
note that some scholars estimate
[hundreds of thousands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textual_variants_in_the_New_Testament)
of textual variants among New Testament documents. There are even cases where
scholars have found that a
[verse was not biblical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma_Johanneum).

Based on this, I propose that arguing theological points using certain words
in the Bible may not be a fruitful course. Even if I agree with you that the
message conveyed is what God intended, the specific texts may not be
letter-for-letter authentic (i.e., future research may discover further
discrepancies).

----

> The Bible seems to very obviously teach that God is one being in three
  persons: the doctrine of the Trinity.

I wish this obviousness had prevailed at the
[council of Chalcedon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Chalcedon), as
it would have avoided the resulting bloodshed between the followers of Cyril
and Nestorious, and the emperor Justinian, saving hundreds of thousands of
lives and healing a rift that has continued to the present day between
[Catholics and the Orthodox church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_–_Roman_Catholic_theological_differences#Trinity).

In sum: This is not an obvious point at all, and many Christians across the
world continue to debate it. There is no need to look to the Bahá'ís for
contending views of the Trinity.

----

> The Bible teaches that we are justified by faith, not our works... It is
  taught that this is a very finalized action, and that nothing beyond that is
  needed and nothing beyond that can help in the atonement of sins.

Bahá'ís also believe that deeds depend on faith, as it is stated at the very
beginning of our book of laws. In fact, all deeds are entirely dependent on
the Good pleasure of God, and do not, of themselves, guarantee anything about
a believer's progress in the next world:

> Were anyone to wash the feet of all mankind, and were he to worship God in
  the forests, valleys, and mountains, upon high hills and lofty peaks, to
  leave no rock or tree, no clod of earth, but was a witness to his worship --
  yet, should the fragrance of My good pleasure not be inhaled from him, his
  works would never be acceptable unto God. -- Bahá'u'lláh

----

> The Bible teaches that Jesus was literally physically raised from the dead,
  but the Baha'i Faith teaches that it was a spiritual resurrection and not a
  physical one by any means.

We are not alone in this: Jehovah's Witnesses -- who certainly consider
themselves Christian -- also teach that the resurrection was spiritual. As do
[some others who identify as Christian](https://www.ecclesia.org/truth/corinthians.html).

[CARM](https://carm.org/jesus-resurrection-was-physical), on the other hand,
is pretty clear about the resurrection being physical. To this I would ask:
what about statements from the Torah that are "clearly physical" that Christ
did not outwardly fulfill? He did not rule with a sword, even though swords
are pretty obvious tools of war.

If Christians are willing to interpret Judaic prophecy figuratively, it should
open the door to examining deeper meanings behind these apparently "obvious"
verses. Is it not possible that the author used a more physical presentation
of his meaning, so that hearers of the time would be certain about the
resurrection of Christ's spirit?

I do not suggest this to say it's true, since I don't know what Thomas
actually witnessed. I merely raise the question as a possibility, since there
are Christians before me who have raised it also.

----

> So, if you are, in fact correct as you say you are, how does the Baha'i
  Faith reconcile these direct contradictions of fundamental beliefs about the
  nature of God and our reality?

We reconcile it by saying that such contradictions arise from human
interpretations of Scripture, not Scripture itself. Scripture, being from God,
is never contradictory -- no matter how obvious such a contradiction may seem.
Whenever it appears to contradict in meaning, it is a challenge to humankind
to deepen its understanding of the inner meaning and intent.

> In truth, were He [God] to pronounce the earth to be heaven, no one hath the
  right to question His authority. -- Bahá'u'lláh

----

> My apologies if any of this came off as rude.

At no point did I think anything you said was rude, or ill-meant!

My hope is for you to become stronger in your Christianity, and your life in
Christ. I'm happy you came here to challenge us in our beliefs, because doing
so is one of the best ways to deepen your own understanding.

# Mumon's poem about his experience

I think that just as there can be over-intellectualization in Zen study, there
can also be under-intellectualization.

I'm not qualified to tell you what Mumon thought, or felt -- and what follows
is probably not found in the words of Zen masters. I offer it only as more
food for thought.

Looking at the context of the story: Mumon did not "just hear the lunchtime
drum" and gain enlightenment. He had been working diligently, for six years,
on the "mu" koan up to this point. So, on this day, what he heard was roughly
the 2000th lunchtime drum, after painstaking deliberation. His mind was ripe,
and I'm guessing he'd thought a fair bit about the drum's role in his life up
to that point.

A drum alone is neither good nor evil: just a percussive sound. But a
lunchtime drum carries additional meaning based on the use we make of it:
signaling lunch. To a monk slaving away at a koan for six years, it might have
also come to mean other things:

  - the promise of satisfaction of hunger and physical emptiness;
  - a break from the tedium of sitting;
  - a time to be around the noise of others for a moment, before going back to
    silence;
  - etc.

In other words, "drum" becomes "lunchtime drum" becomes "lunchtime drum
colored by experience". I imagine that, after six years, the lunchtime drum
was a significant moment within the day, with quite an effect on
consciousness. Especially since there was so little else going on that could
have a similar effect, as it was connected to a deep, physical motivation
(hunger).

So maybe, just maybe, when the drum sounded, Mumon realized his true self had
become "Mumon" in the same way the drum had turned into a "lunchtime" drum;
and all the extra meaning imbued in that drum was like the layers on top of
"Mumon". "mu" wipes it all away, down to the nature underneath, "the original
Face".

# Prezi uses Haskell

I want to offer a different experience from Jon, so that people know that
Haskell can also be perfectly suitable for this sort of development.

I worked at FP Complete during the time they were building their Web IDE; I
also wrote an in-house billing system to support sales for that IDE. All of
this code, written by several people, used many different Haskell features:
transformer stacks, exceptions, networking, concurrency, databases, Template
Haskell, the C FFI, etc We didn't use many advanced, type-level features,
which may be one reason the experience was so much better. We also used
conduit pretty much everywhere from the beginning, which helped keep space
usage and performance constant.

Overall, Haskell was a great language to develop this application in. It
allowed a fairly small team to respond quickly to changing requirements, and
let us build feature-rich, performant code within a brief time table. Space
leaks were fairly rare, and I don't recall pulling my hair out to find them.
Also, our target was rather performance sensitive (especially with regard to
latency), so it wasn't that we were ignoring these issues, either.

We did learn a few things, though. First, keep the amount of "richness" to a
moderate level. Introducing new libraries and new language features often came
at a price that was only discovered much later. I remember tracking down a
latency bug for several days that ended up stemming from a recent use of the
"pretty-show" library to prettify debug strings, not realizing how slow it can
be if the values have a large amount of structure. Sticking with ordinary
"show" would have avoided the problem.

Type classes were often more trouble than they were worth. Transformer stacks
were bad, too, in terms of type errors, but you get used to them. You just
need to understand the semantics of how the levels interact very, very well.

Error handling was mostly resolved by using Either to reflect evaluation
failures (i.e., an input value that didn't make sense), and exceptions to
reflect execution failures (e.g., trying to read from a socket that was
suddenly closed).

The lack of standardization didn't bite so hard, because again, we weren't
using much beyond Haskell2010 and several convenience features (ViewPatterns,
OverloadedStrings, DeriveFunctor, etc). I'm not against the use of advanced
features, but they come at a cost that needs to be understood from prior
experience, rather than inflicted on a new project for the first time.

My worst bugs ever? They came in two flavors: crashes in C and C++ over the
FFI (typically a nightmare to debug); and cases where the type system was
unable to detect a semantics violation (for example, passing a function to
"hoist" that fit the type, but was not a monad morphism).

I also came to a gradual awareness that if you feel like you're pushing your
code uphill, you're doing too much work. Good Haskell has a certain lightness
of being to it, making it typically quite easy to debug and extend. Whenever
the code stopped having this feeling, almost invariably it was because I'd
added something that shouldn't have been there. I recall many pleasant
evenings reviewing code with Michael Snoyman, only to watch half the functions
and variables disappear because we were using too many "words" to say a simple
thing.

If you try to cram everything Haskell can do into one project, expect it to
fail brilliantly. But if you apply the right economy of thought, I think you
will find it quite rewarding.

# Question about the Seal of the Prophets

There are actually several meanings to this station. One is that Muhammad is
the last of the cycle of Prophethood, before the coming of the Twin
Manifestations, the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh.

But another is that every Manifestation is both the beginning and the end, the
Alpha and the Omega. They are to be regarded as the same Soul, with the same
Purpose. In such a station, They are all the Origin, and They are all the
Seal.

Every time a Messenger of God claims that They are "the Way", it challenges
humankind to understand the essential unity of that Ancient Being. He appears
from age to age, and cycle to cycle; all that differs is the form of the
Message -- to suit our needs and understanding -- and not the beauty of His
Light.

For example, consider the rising sun. Whether at dawn, noon or twilight, it is
the same Sun at every stage. The intensity and color of its revelation
differs, but the nature of the sun itself is constant. The morning Sun could
truthfully claim, "My rays precede the night." With respect to what we know of
mornings, this statement might be difficult to comprehend; but with regard to
the sun's own reality, it is completely true.

# Question about Moral Laws

One thing to keep in mind is that God can arbitrarily do things without
justification. A parent does not need a child's approval or understanding to
lay down rules in the home. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá writes, "He doeth as He doeth, and
what recourse have we? He carrieth out His Will, He ordaineth what He
pleaseth. Then better for thee to bow down thy head in submission, and put thy
trust in the All-Merciful Lord."

Why He has ordained certain things will always be a challenge, since our
understanding is woefully incomplete. If indeed God sees all and knows all,
then He sees things we do not.

# Question about Moral Laws

The Faith of God is generally quite considerate of people's minds, but there
are some changes that need to happen whether we understand them or not. A
doctor often explains his remedy to you, but sometimes the issue is too
complex for a satisfying description. Does this mean the doctor cannot be
trusted?

Bahá’u’lláh writes: "Know verily that the essence of justice and the source
thereof are both embodied in the ordinances prescribed by Him Who is the
Manifestation of the Self of God amongst men, if ye be of them that recognize
this truth. He doth verily incarnate the highest, the infallible standard of
justice unto all creation.... Were men to discover the motivating purpose of
God's Revelation, they would assuredly cast away their fears, and, with hearts
filled with gratitude, rejoice with exceeding gladness."

# Euthyphro's Dilemma

Why is it wrong for morality to be arbitrary? If God created existence, He
knows what benefits us in this existence. The idea that there is a higher
standard God should refer to when ruling His creation makes it meaningless to
use the word "God".

I think the real question is: Can we trust God? If He is the author of all, is
He presenting us with a fair and beneficial moral code, or is He being devious
or frivolous in some way?

This is a very important, and personal, point to contemplate. Many accuse God
of being unfair. What do you think?

# My First Baha'i Holiday

What you describe lies at the heart of the religious experience:

> For the core of religious faith is that mystic feeling which unites Man with
  God. This state of spiritual communion can be brought about and maintained
  by means of meditation and prayer. And this is the reason why Bahá’u’lláh
  has so much stressed the importance of worship. It is not sufficient for a
  believer merely to accept and observe the teachings. He should, in addition,
  cultivate the sense of spirituality which he can acquire chiefly by means of
  prayer. The Bahá’í Faith, like all other Divine Religions, is thus
  fundamentally mystic in character. Its chief goal is the development of the
  individual and society, through the acquisition of spiritual virtues and
  powers. It is the soul of man which has first to be fed. And this spiritual
  nourishment prayer can best provide. -- Shoghi Effendi

# Euthyphro's Dilemma

The ability to create arbitrarily is what defines "God"; otherwise, there
would exist a higher standard, and what would the nature of that standard be?

> With a look He granteth a hundred thousand hopes, with a glance He healeth a
  hundred thousand incurable ills, with a nod He layeth balm on every wound,
  with a glimpse He freeth the hearts from the shackles of grief. He doeth as
  He doeth, and what recourse have we? He carrieth out His Will, He ordaineth
  what He pleaseth. Then better for thee to bow down thy head in submission,
  and put thy trust in the All-Merciful Lord.

# A Continuation on the Euthyphro Dilemma

If I understand correctly, your question boils down to: "Who created God?"

The only thing even close to an answer I can offer is that the concept of
"creation", and its opposite "destruction", exist because of the nature of the
reality within which we posit these questions. At the level of God's own
Being, it is unreasonable to assume a similar ontological structure to the
world that we know and that governs our reasoning.

I think Wittgenstein said it best: "Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must
be silent."

# In this day every believer must concentrate his thoughts on teaching the
  Faith...

I agree with you that teaching is about planting a seed, and not just making
people aware that the seed exists; and while the growth of the seed is not our
task, as you suggested, we don't plant it merely to stick it in the ground.

Planting is still a (relatively) easy process. Consolidation, or nurturing
growth when it finally happens toward a strong plant that can, in turn, cast
its own seeds, this is where the real work lies.

I guess I separate these two, to overcome the barriers many people feel toward
teaching as being a huge burden and responsibility. Teaching is really about
imparting your joy and wonder at this thing you've discovered. Beyond that,
however, there is a duty to nurture that soul. You can say this is "part of
teaching", or you can say it is what happens after teaching. Whatever you find
the most encouraging.

# Between fear and love

The following is from http://iranpresswatch.org/post/3812/, written by a
Baha'i, Aram Anahid:

Baha’i writings assert that while social order is upheld by means of reward
and punishment, the banner of religion is uplifted by Khashiyat Allah, or the
fear of God:

> The word of God which the Abha Pen hath revealed and inscribed on the first
  leaf of the Most Exalted Paradise is this: Verily I say: The fear of God
  hath ever been a sure defense and a safe stronghold for all the peoples of
  the world. It is the chief cause of the protection of mankind, and the
  supreme instrument for its preservation.[7]

“Khashiyat Allah” is a Quranic term that refers to a sense of awe and
reverence inspired by an individual’s recognition of the majesty of God.
According to Tousi, khashiyat defers from khauf (fear) in that while khauf is
a painful feeling brought on by the prospect of punishment, khashiyat is an
emotional state induced by an individual’s recognition of the Absolute
Greatness of God.[8] While both khauf and khashyiat are seen as psychological
states that can cause obedience to God, the two operate differently. In the
case of khashyiat, obedience is caused not by fear of punishment, but by the
love of God.

The distinction between khauf and khashyiat finds expression in Baha’i
writings:

> In formulating the principles and laws a part hath been devoted to penalties
  which form an effective instrument for the security and protection of men.
  However, dread (khauf) of the penalties maketh people desist only outwardly
  from committing vile and contemptible deeds, while that which guardeth and
  restraineth man both outwardly and inwardly hath been and still is the fear
  of God (khashiyat Allah). It is man’s true protector and his spiritual
  guardian. It behoveth him to cleave tenaciously unto that which will lead to
  the appearance of this supreme bounty.[9]

# Between fear and love

Not only that, but from another letter written on behalf of the Guardian
(Lights of Guidance, #1664):

> The Bahá'ís should try to study history anew, and to base all their
  investigations first and foremost on the written Scriptures of Islam and
  Christianity.

Ignoring the historical context of our Faith will only make it seem more
mysterious. There are a number of places where it references centuries of
debate in a single phrase; not knowing the debate leads one to understand only
the surface meaning of such references.

# Two Questions About Baha'i God

"If this is the same God, then why does he make the religions contradict each
other?"

We believe that God is the Supreme physician, Who knows the remedy for each
age in which He appears to man through the Manifestations of God. He knows
what needs to be said, and how, in order to effect the best result for society
at each time.

Until we are capable of judging the entirety of God's plan, saying that God is
confused is like saying that a doctor is confused because the remedy he gave
us in childhood doesn't correspond, in our view, with another remedy he gives
us in adulthood.

# Have you ever had a spiritual quickening type experience that destabilized
  your life?

Btw, Sufis call what you describe Hal. As one Sufi writer puts it, "[Hal is]
something that descends from God into a man’s heart, without his being able to
repel it when it comes, or to attract it as it goes, by his own effort." The
opposite of this -- an enduring change that is the result of diligent and
sincere effort -- is Maqam. In English we translate Hal as "state" and Maqam
as "station".

Bahá’u’lláh frequently uses both of these words in His Writings. He describes
the Seven Valleys within the framework of three Maqam (limitation, unity,
annihilation and eternity in God). Because God grants us favors through His
grace, I imagine we also experience them as Hal, temporarily.

# A teenager seeking for answers about Bahai

It really depends on the person, as with anything else. There are those of us
who do just want your well-being, and what you do or don't believe is between
you and God. The best way to learn the truth of someone's motives is to
befriend them, and afterward, keep with those who are sincere. It's a
beautiful Faith, with much to offer, but it doesn't convey instant perfection
on anyone.

# A teenager seeking for answers about Bahai

It's actually good that you're having a hard time thinking about God! God is a
perfect mystery, and no mind will ever know Him. What leads us to
understanding are: purity of heart, chastity of soul, and freedom of spirit. I
very much agree with your atheism, if it's the grandfather-in-the-sky God
you're thinking of. Seek the God Whose attributes are reflected in your own
heart, and Whose light dawns from the Holy Scriptures.

# To Bequeath to the Needy

The quote itself doesn't use the word generosity... The wealth that a man
gives to others may be fruitfully used by them, in which case the giver is
partly responsible for that fruit as well. It could be these results that
profit him after death, and not only the spirit in which it was given. Once he
is passed, the man will recognize the truth of things, and so I'm sure he will
see the benefit resulting from his gift, some of which may then return to him.

# Bearer of this Tablet

Something else to keep in mind is that, historically, Bahá’u’lláh wrote many
tablets to specific people, and He would sometimes give that tablet to one of
the believers to deliver by hand, a journey that could take months, or that
might incur great danger (such as Badi's delivery of the Tablet to
Nasiru'd-Din Shah, which resulted in his death). Since these bearers were
performing a dangerous service to God in this capacity, it is not strange that
Bahá’u’lláh might include a prayer to God that they be kept safe on their way.

# A teenager seeking for answers about Bahai

In the mystical writings of the Bahá’í Faith, there is much written about how,
as souls, we may approach God through the purification of our hearts, and
readying ourselves to receive His grace. For example, in the Seven Valleys
Bahá’u’lláh writes:

> For God is, in His Essence, holy above ascent and descent, entrance and
  exit; He hath through all eternity been free of the attributes of human
  creatures, and ever will remain so. No man hath ever known Him; no soul hath
  ever found the pathway to His Being. Every mystic knower hath wandered far
  astray in the valley of the knowledge of Him; every saint hath lost his way
  in seeking to comprehend His Essence. Sanctified is He above the
  understanding of the wise; exalted is He above the knowledge of the knowing!
  The way is barred and to seek it is impiety; His proof is His signs; His
  being is His evidence.

So how we can understand God at all? It happens that we can be near to God,
even in this life, but it happens in the heart, not the mind. In the Four
Valleys it says:

> How can feeble reason encompass the Qur’án, Or the spider snare a phoenix in
  his web? Wouldst thou that the mind should not entrap thee? Teach it the
  science of the love of God!

And the other quote I was vaguely referring to before was this one:

> The understanding of His words and the comprehension of the utterances of
  the Birds of Heaven are in no wise dependent upon human learning. They
  depend solely upon purity of heart, chastity of soul, and freedom of spirit.
  This is evidenced by those who, today, though without a single letter of the
  accepted standards of learning, are occupying the loftiest seats of
  knowledge; and the garden of their hearts is adorned, through the showers of
  divine grace, with the roses of wisdom and the tulips of understanding. Well
  is it with the sincere in heart for their share of the light of a mighty
  Day!

I could write a lot more about this, but I'll stop here. If you have further
questions, please ask.

# Bahaullah writings on chastity?

He wrote many things about purity and rectitude of conduct, as well as
centering one's desires on God, as did the Báb. Although not often an explicit
reference to sexual chastity, the latter is just one aspect of the former.

# Need Advice

Being acutely aware of a lack of connection is actually a good thing, because
it shows sincerity in your search for God. I would suggest: keep reading the
Writings, meditating, reflecting, and being active in your search. Also, check
out the Valley of Search; it has much to say about this, in my opinion.

# THW, P68

Some of the Hidden Words address those wayward divines who, at the time of the
Manifestation, misled the generality of the people, and incited them to rise
up against and slay those Blessed Souls. A number of the Persian Hidden Words
are written in this vein, such as the one that begins "O ye seeming fair yet
inwardly foul!"

As for the bolded part, I agree with tgisfw: These misguided people have
stained themselves by their actions; but instead of realizing their
misbehavior and repenting before God, they have reached out to grasp what is
not theirs to take.

# Copper into Gold

A beauty of the Divine Writings is that they operate on many levels. A passage
does not need to be only literal, or only metaphorical: it can be both at
once. There is often harmony between divine creation and physical creation,
since both come from the same source. So, I agree with you that there are many
layers of metaphorical meaning in these passages; it also would not surprise
me to learn that they are literally true. Future scientists will let us know.

# THW, A64

Thanks for asking this. It prompted me to go back and translate the Hidden
Word for myself, to see which terms are being used in the original:

> My eternity (azaliyyat) is my excellent handiwork, make it the robe of thy
  temple (haykal). My unity (a.hadiyyat) was created for thee, make it the
  garment of thy self (nafs), that thou mayest forever (until abad) be the
  dawning place of my Qayyúm (a Naqshbandi sufi term meaning "a dignitary upon
  whom the whole order of existence depends").

This reminds me of the following statement from Bahá’u’lláh:

> The light of a good character surpasseth the light of the sun and the
  radiance thereof. Whoso attaineth unto it is accounted as a jewel among men.
  The glory and the upliftment of the world must needs depend upon it.

And also from the Seven Valleys:

> Whensoever the light of Manifestation of the King of Oneness settleth upon
  the throne of the heart and soul, His shining becometh visible in every limb
  and member. At that time the mystery of the famed tradition gleameth out of
  the darkness: "A servant is drawn unto Me in prayer until I answer him; and
  when I have answered him, I become the ear wherewith he heareth...." For
  thus the Master of the house hath appeared within His home, and all the
  pillars of the dwelling are ashine with His light. And the action and effect
  of the light are from the Light-Giver; so it is that all move through Him
  and arise by His will. And this is that spring whereof the near ones drink,
  as it is said: "A fount whereof the near unto God shall drink...."

Note also that within the Seven Valleys, there are three stations given
(maqámát): The first is that of limitation (ta.hdíd), but the second is unity
(taw.híd) and the third is dying from self and living eternally in God (fanáy
az nafs va baqáy billáh). Compare this with the "immortal sovereignty" you've
read in other places, and maybe it will offer some insights.

A nice thing about these passages is that you can memorize them and ponder
them for a lifetime; they are an excellent subject of meditation and
reflection. None of us can know for certain what they mean in this lifetime,
but their beauty and hope is a continual source of inspiration.

# Prayer: "Glory be to Thee, O Lord my God!"

Hi Kamal19, this is highly symbolic! It might be better to continue reading it
as you move on to other passages from the Writings, and come back to it
whenever they seem to relate. There is a lot of powerful imagery in this
prayer, some of which relates to other prayers and symbolic imagery from past
Dispensations. For example, the "stars" that "shine brightly" in "heaven" has
been used before to refer to those believers who manifest through their deeds
and character the powers latent in God's Revelation.

# How to start liking people?

> Is there some sort of trick to dealing with people that I am not aware of?
  How do you not let the problems of the world overwhelm you? How am I
  supposed to take part in the betterment of the world if I can't stand being
  around other people to help.

This is such a beautiful, sincere question. I love you for asking it. Indeed,
it is the very heart of the matter!

> The divine friends must be attracted to and enamored of each other and ever
  be ready and willing to sacrifice their own lives for each other. Should one
  soul from amongst the believers meet another, it must be as though a thirsty
  one with parched lips has reached to the fountain of the water of life, or a
  lover has met his true beloved. For one of the greatest divine wisdoms
  regarding the appearance of the holy Manifestations is this: The souls may
  come to know each other and become intimate with each other; the power of
  the love of God may make all of them the waves of one sea, the flowers of
  one rose garden, and the stars of one heaven. This is the wisdom for the
  appearance of the holy Manifestations! When the most great bestowal reveals
  itself in the hearts of the believers, the world of nature will be
  transformed, the darkness of the contingent being will vanish, and heavenly
  illumination will be obtained. Then the whole world will become the Paradise
  of Abhá, every one of the believers of God will become a blessed tree,
  producing wonderful fruits. -- ‘Abdu’l-Bahá

I believe that this mystery lies at the very core of our mystical Writings: to
find the truth of the Divine Unity, that others are not actually "other" but
rather reflections of the same Essence that animates our own being. It's about
transcending a local notion of self and becoming global; something that is not
easily done, or just a matter of understanding some concept or idea, but that
requires a deep and fundamental change in our very vision of what reality is.
And such a change demands regular study of the Writings, sacrifice, a thirst
to be transformed, and above all, Divine assistance, called upon through
constant use of prayer.

> When the disciples heard this they were greatly astonished and asked, "Who
  then can be saved?" Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is
  impossible, but with God all things are possible." -- Matthew, 19:25-26

# Thinking about becoming (converting?) Baha'i but I want to get perspectives

Hi sypnopsize. I converted at age 18, after being a strong atheist, and then
an agnostic.

I'll tell you what my mother told me: Meet the people. Spend some time around
the Bahá’ís, until you get a feeling for their character and motivations.
Also, you can always un-join, there is no permanent commitment being made
here.

It took a while before the Faith became a part of who I really was, but for
the first years I still enjoyed it a lot. I made some good friends whom I've
kept in contact with to this day (26 years later). Plus, it's a very welcoming
community no matter where in the world you go, or who you are.

Feel free to ask any other questions that come to mind.

# Thinking about becoming (converting?) Baha'i but I want to get perspectives

It's funny you should ask this, since my beloved cousin (a Christian) is
marrying another woman next month, and this has forced me to think a lot about
these issues.

On the level of spirit, everything is about love and acceptance. We should
love each other the way God loves us -- so much so that if we meet another
soul, "... it must be as though a thirsty one with parched lips has reached to
the fountain of the Water of Life, or a lover has met his true beloved"!

At the same time, God challenges mankind to evolve, and some of the things He
asks of us, for the benefit of the whole, require sacrifice from individuals.
For example, although society upholds the individual pursuit of happiness as
an ideal, and sexual expression and identity as key components of that
happiness, the Faith only allows sex within the bonds of marriage, and then
only between a man and a woman. No matter how strongly two people may feel for
one another -- whatever their gender -- the fundamental purpose of marriage is
social, and not a way of fulfilling our own hopes and dreams, as modern
society often portrays it.

This is just one of the ways we're asked to subordinate the interests of self
to a greater purpose. The belief is that the soul has a far greater destiny
than the body, and since it is without gender and physical need, these things
should not be confounded with the meaning of happiness. Only by accepting the
counsels of the Manifestation of God for each age does true civilization
emerge, and then only do we properly glimpse why human beings were made to be.

# haskell.org and the Evil Cabal

Hi everyone: Haskell.org committee member here -- although I'm not writing
this as a representative of the committee. I just wanted to share a few of my
own thoughts, since some of you might wonder what other people on the
committee think about all this.

There are, perhaps, a few exaggerations being made about what exactly the
committee does, and how we do it. I personally talk to other committee members
-- as a committee -- a few times a year. Every once in a while, we vote on a
mailing list about decisions that affect the public. That's all. The rest of
our business pretty much proceeds unattended, except when questions arise
about the legality of students who want to participate in the Summer of Code,
or financial questions about receiving donations.

I agree that mailing lists are becoming too narrow a medium; at the same time,
it's hard to find something truly representative. Some of you may know I'm
also the Emacs maintainer, and we use mailing lists there too -- and receive
many of the same complaints about inaccessibility, and too much inward-focus.
Yet there are several influential people in our community who aren't
accessible by anything but e-mail (our beloved SPJ is neither a Twitter nor a
Reddit user!), so a true medium for collaboration would need to take place on
many channels simultaneously. This sounds like an interesting technical and
social problem to solve, especially as the number of mechanisms for
communication continues to proliferate (many of my friends use apps I hadn't
even heard of until recently).

I love the Haskell language, and its excellent blending of theory and
practice, and I also enjoy nearly all the Haskellers I've met over the years,
including Michael Snoyman, a former co-worker of mine. It saddens me to see
disputes of this kind, no matter who they're from, or why. It also surprises
me to be thought of as evil, in any respect. All I can do is continue to serve
the interests of the wider Haskell community as best I can, no matter what
happens. If you all want me removed to make way for a braver new world, that's
OK too. There are always other interesting things to do.

I hope everyone will take some time to remember why we're doing this together
in the first place. We love this technology, we love its promise and
potential, we love the learning attitudes it engenders, and the way it
embraces ideas as far afield as REST APIs and the lambda calculus. I think
it's here that we can find a better path forward, rather than getting caught
up in who said what when.

# Regarding Islam's Relationship to the Bahá’í Faith in the Context of Progressive Revelation

One thing to always keep in mind is context. When Christ appeared, He said
that He came only to bring the Word of God to the Jews, not the gentiles,
although He later changed this after a gentile woman of great faith pleaded
for His help.

In other words, Christ came to address a people who had already known 3,000
years of worshiping a monotheistic God, and following the laws of God. As with
every Manifestation of God, Christ sought to advance their spiritual
understanding. He chose at that time to give them a deeper understanding of
the spiritual dimensions of worship (love, forgiveness, virtue), and not just
further expound on the Law.

Muhammad, on the other hand, came to the tribes of Arabia, who were fierce
idol-worshippers at that time, following their own traditions, and who already
had a history of slaying earlier prophets outright (see the story of Salih in
Qur'an).

So, while it is true that Christianity came 'before' Islam in the progressive
scheme, the context of these two Faiths was very different, and God chooses
the best remedy for the ills of each age.

It's a hard thing to judge God by the standards of human morality, especially
when we see only the physical world, and our understanding is bounded by time.
We have no idea what would have happened in the world if a Manifestation like
Christ had appeared among the Arabs, instead of the strength of Muhammad.
However, God does know what would have happened, "and verily, He is the best
of planners."

# Developing a very unhealthy attitude towards Islam/Muslims

As one Bahá’í to another, I'm very glad you do not simply accept your opinions
of Islam, and consider them justified based on past experiences. You clearly
want to understand and move beyond your feelings. I have other Middle Eastern
friends who feeling almost exactly the same way you do, and who have said many
of the same things to me.

I grew up a Westerner, and so my introduction and first experiences of Islam
were through Sufism. There is so much beauty there, and reveling in
contradiction! God's Will is adored because it is mysterious. It's a shame
that the beauty of Islam is lost in today's media. There is so much richness,
while certain sects have only skimmed the surface, and abused it to very harsh
ends.

I cannot deny there are things I do not understand in the Qur'an, just as
there are in the Old Testament (and in abundance). The world is not how I
would have made it. But spiritual insight does not come from comprehending
God's actions in terms we understand; we must break our minds a bit, and
tackle these problems within our hearts, so that inspiration may take the
place of limited understanding.

I'm sorry to be infuriating, but it's not enough just to tolerate Islam, or
resign it to some antiquity of history: we must become lovers of Muhammad if
we are ever to truly recognize the Ancient Beauty, Who has reappeared from age
to age, cycle after cycle. If we embrace our Friend wearing one robe, but
reject Him wearing another, what friends are we?

Anyone can love God if it were easy to do so; what glory to those who love Him
not just despite it's being hard, but because of it! In the Panj Kanz Nabil
reports Bahá’u’lláh having said:

> Dost thou know what sort of person is worthy of hearing My words and is fit
  to enter My presence? I will say it that thou shalt know. Suppose one should
  find himself in a limitless space, unbounded in every direction. To the
  right, there existeth every pomp and glory, pleasure and comfort, and
  sovereignty eternal and stainless; and to the left is prepared every
  calamity and hardship, vengeance and poverty, and vicissitude unyielding and
  perpetual. Suppose then that the Faithful Spirit should call out, from the
  precincts of the Lord of the Worlds, to that one, saying, “Shouldst thou
  choose the right—with its eternal pleasures and all that is therein—over the
  left, thou wouldst not, in the estimation of God, be abased in the least;
  and shouldst thou choose the left—with its perpetual hardships and all that
  is therein—over the right, it would not add an ounce to thy worth in the
  sight of the Almighty, the Unconstrained.” Should that one choose, at that
  moment, the left over the right—afire with ardor and zeal, and filled with
  rapture and ecstasy—then would he be fit to enter My presence and worthy of
  hearing My magnificent words.

This world, with all its confusion, is our chance to show our mettle. Be glad
that faith is not easy, because in that difficulty lies the true prize.

# Developing a very unhealthy attitude towards Islam/Muslims

That's a difficult topic to clarify within the space of a reddit comment, but
if I may attempt it: God-given trials, the inherent difficulties of this
existence, are created to a purpose. When a person has so recognized that
purpose as to embrace them, then he is truly ready to hear His Revelation. If,
on the other hand, our wish is to avoid all difficulty -- even if such a
choice were acceptable in God's sight -- we will have missed part of the
picture, and a necessary piece in understanding this great Puzzle.

# How to see the best in everyone?

I think that seeing the best in everyone, and everything, is one of the truths
to be discovered along the path of the Seven Valleys, since the Divine Unity
is at the heart of the perception needed for such an attitude. "That we may
know only Thee, and see only Thee, and think of none save Thee."

# Did Jesus die for our sins as the Bible says?

When I read the words of Christ, sometimes I hear Him speaking as the Christ
-- the Manifestation for humanity two thousand years ago -- and sometimes as
the voice of the Primal Will: the Ancient Beauty and Holy Spirit animating all
the Prophets and Messengers of God.

In this latter station, when He states, "None shall come to the Father but
through Me", it makes perfect sense. How else can humanity recognize God,
except through the Primal Will? We cannot hold direct communion with the
Infinite, so we depend on His Intermediaries to acquire knowledge of the
worlds beyond.

Likewise, when He says, in this perfect station, that He has suffered and died
for our sins, it matches up exactly with similar statements made by
Bahá'u'lláh, for example in Summons of the Lord of the Hosts:

> My body hath borne imprisonment that your souls may be released from
  bondage, and We have consented to be abased that ye may be exalted. Follow
  the Lord of glory and dominion, and not every ungodly oppressor. My body
  longeth for the cross, and Mine head awaiteth the thrust of the spear, in
  the path of the All-Merciful, that the world may be purged from its
  transgressions. Thus hath the Daystar of divine authority shone forth from
  the horizon of the Revelation of Him Who is the Possessor of all names and
  attributes.

And in the Gleanings He writes:

> The Ancient Beauty hath consented to be bound with chains that mankind may
  be released from its bondage, and hath accepted to be made a prisoner within
  this most mighty Stronghold that the whole world may attain unto true
  liberty. He hath drained to its dregs the cup of sorrow, that all the
  peoples of the earth may attain unto abiding joy, and be filled with
  gladness. This is of the mercy of your Lord, the Compassionate, the Most
  Merciful. We have accepted to be abased, O believers in the Unity of God,
  that ye may be exalted, and have suffered manifold afflictions, that ye
  might prosper and flourish. He Who hath come to build anew the whole world,
  behold, how they that have joined partners with God have forced Him to dwell
  within the most desolate of cities!

# Heroes and virtues

Within us, each day, there is a struggle that could certainly be called
heroic. And I don't mean not eating that chocolate donut on the counter. I'm
talking about the heroism of being kind to those who annoy us, or holding to
truth even when others look down on us for doing so.

In those moments, although we are certainly not Kyrptonian, we need to be as
strong as steel, and to pierce the veils of vain imaginings with eyes of
flame! Our spirits should be free to "fly with the utmost joy and happiness
throughout the illimitable space", until we find a new way of seeing that
leads to right behavior.

> ... those personages who in a single step have passed over the world of the
  relative and the limited, and dwelt on the fair plane of the Absolute, and
  pitched their tent in the worlds of authority and command—have burned away
  these relativities with a single spark, and blotted out these words with a
  drop of dew. And they swim in the sea of the spirit, and soar in the holy
  air of light.

# House Cleaning

Your struggle with cleanliness can become a subject of daily practice and
meditation. "Life is suffering", but the object is not the end of suffering
any more than it is an end to life. What you seek is the end of "suffering".
The sage is in fact most fully alive.

I don't think Zen should be confused with an enervating nihilism steeped in
word-play. Be refined, be perfected, because it is your joy: as a wolf howling
at the moon, or a beaver building his dam. Humans are ennobled by their
thought; a snow tiger who abandons his fur is not made any warmer. It's out of
his climate that it becomes suffocating.

# Guidance on investing in and supporting businesses

I tend to see money as a proxy for direct action: Instead of going out to farm
strawberries, I give money to someone who has farmed them on my behalf.
Likewise, when I invest in a business, I'm virtually working for that
business, doing whatever they're doing to change the world. But this is a
personal viewpoint, and I offer it only in the sense of not viewing money as
an abstract, but as fungible with action. The same principle could be applied
to deputizing others to serve as travel teachers, when you cannot.

# Praying in a language you don't understand: quotes?

Consider too that we don't know the true meaning of the texts, even in our own
language! It's like hearing words spoken by a friend: little by little they
deepen the relationship, but it would need infinite lifetimes to know the
complete depths of their soul.

Prayer is propinquity. If we are drawing closer to God, the means are blessed;
if not, no amount of understanding can replace the efficacy of God's
good-pleasure.

# If my credibility is being questioned, I will simply step down.

To everyone: Please do not judge Eli harshly by the contents of messages sent
to a mailing list.

English is not his first language. He is also much more interested in getting
things done than talking about how to do them. As someone who has spoken to
him directly on a few occasions, and works with him regularly, my opinion is
that Eli is exactly the sort of person you want to have in a maintainership
position: He's not quick to act, he considers issues from all angles, and he
doesn't buy into nonsense or hype.

Sometimes such a mature attitude can be frustrating to those who see a flaw
and want it resolved as immediately as possible. The language barrier -- and
the medium of text -- combine at times to make it seem like Eli is being gruff
or unsympathetic to such concerns.

However, I urge you to see past the medium to recognize the person, as I have,
and then you would be doing everything in your power to prevent him from
becoming disparaged. Eli is a big reason why Emacs continues to sail straight,
and I'd really appreciate it if everyone made the effort to see that. Help him
instead of fight with him, and we'll get far more accomplished together.

# I'm bored

Appreciation is truly the lost art. If you were stuck in solitary confinement
for some years, you'd revel in those boring people like drops of gold.
Everything is perspective, vision. It's one thing to see; it's another
altogether to see how you see.

# Combining Functors on Free Monads

What you're describing is called "the expression problem", and there have been
many strategies explored to manage it, such as recent work on "extensible
effects", the Freer monad, and the van Laarhoven free monad.

Another way to approach it is to use Free over a simple, core language, but a
final encoding to shallowly embed a surface language, as described in
Combining Deep and Shallow Embedding for EDSLs.

The classic paper that covers the techniques you describe above (functoral
products) is Wouter's on Datatypes à la carte. If you go deeper down this
road, there are papers exploring how functoral coproducts can be used to
express compositional interpreters.

# Progress

It's not about progressing, or not progressing. Avoiding either one misses the
point. Mastery of something requires great effort and attention, and I don't
believe for a second that fully living means stumbling through life without
applying one's self.

What you seek is no one detail, or the lack thereof. You won't find it by
seeking progress, or avoiding it, or deciding it doesn't exist, or saying it
has no meaning. All of these lead back to the same place, right where you
started.

Who ever told you you aren't the carrot?

# To those of you who converted to the Bahá'í Faith from another religion or lack thereof, WHY did you choose Bahá'í?

Hi! For myself, I followed a progression of Christian (Methodist) to strong
atheist (very anti-religious) to agnostic ("Let's be honest, I don't know") to
the Bahá’í Faith.

I was not seeking at the time, nor interested in religion. What I did love was
philosophy, and the principle that until I can disprove something, it is
worthy of consideration. When I started talking to a Bahá’í on my college
campus, and his answers kept making more and more sense, I felt compelled to
research further.

It was several months before I was comfortable saying the word "God", or
praying, or reading the Writings of the founders of the Bahá’í Faith. I was
driven by a deep sense of its truth, more than any of the outer aspects.

Of course, I also knew that after joining, I could always unjoin, so I took my
mother's advice and became a part of the religion, while always keeping an eye
out for suspect or hypocritical behavior. It took several years before I truly
"believed", rather than constantly arguing about the correctness of the Faith
in my mind.

Now it's twenty-six years later, and the world looks very different to me.
There is a door to reality that human beings are capable of opening, and
religion is uniquely suited to unlock. Those who believe life is just the
material adventures of some clever animals, have yet to scratch the surface.

Good luck with your report!

# To those of you who converted to the Bahá'í Faith from another religion or lack thereof, WHY did you choose Bahá'í?

Six years after I joined the Faith, my mother did as well. She told me that
after I moved away from home, she "missed the presence of those wonderful
people". So she began her own exploration of the Writings, and declared her
belief maybe a year after. I'd describe the rest of my family as atheists,
although while not believing in "God", I wouldn't say they fully disbelieve in
any concept of spirituality.

Religious institutions, and especially formalized conceptions of "Godhood",
have done a lot of damage to the world's understanding of religion and God.
These are things every person needs to explore for themselves, and not just be
told what they mean. If you believe in the potential of human beings, and that
there is more to life than what is obvious, then I think we have a lot in
common, no matter if we agree or disagree on the surface.

# What does Daily meditation look like to a Baha'i?

I think there are many forms of meditation, depending on whom you ask and what
their aim is. As long as the fruit of it draws one nearer to God, I hope we
explore even newer forms as society progresses.

Some meditations I've found useful are: Looking for the root of how I
experience the world. Examining my emotions. Reviewing the value of my actions
during the day. Seeking to appreciate the beauty of the word of God as I
recite it. Focusing on a person, and trying to see them in terms of their
unity, not their differences. Freely roaming, almost day-dreaming, on
spiritual themes. Among others.

# What does Daily meditation look like to a Baha'i?

Thanks for making it more specific! There are several places where I enter
into a state that feels meditative, of various qualities:

A favorite is taking a walk around my house for an hour, focusing on the
rhythm of a walking stick, reciting passages I've committed to memory. I try
to feel and savor the fragrance from those passages, so usually they're from
Hidden Words or the Seven Valleys. Mystical, positive subjects work well.
Reflecting on the bounty and love of God.

Some others: lying in my bed before I fall asleep, when thoughts drift;
driving in the car, just silence and pondering; when I'm bored, standing in a
line or waiting for someone. Sometimes it's worthwhile to intentionally switch
to the slower line or lane, challenging myself to reflect instead of feeling
hurried.

I usually don't involve physical aids, since I'm not a fan of pictures or
symbols. The best tools for me are silence and the memorized Word; also,
recalling challenges from the day that ruffled my feathers, to realize how
petty I was being.

# Alan Watts a modern thinker talks about the games we make out of material
  life.

I've always greatly enjoyed Alan Watts -- and Krishnamurti, Ayn Rand, Sartre,
and many others who, on the face of it, say things contradictory to Bahá’í
teachings about the soul and God.

However, these contradictions are often in the realm of perception: my
understanding of what they're saying vs. my understanding of the Faith. If I
make an effort to see past those differences, there are often illuminating
threads of commonality.

One of the most profound spiritual experiences of my life came after reading
Ayn Rand's "Atlas Shrugged" -- a book that very openly rails against
spiritualism -- because it caused me to see something I hadn't before, and
freed me from how I'd been reading Bahá’u’lláh's words up to that moment.
Whatever liberates the heart from the trappings of mind is worth pondering;
whatever leads the mind to cage the heart is not.

On my nightstand right now is a book from Watts: The Wisdom of Insecurity. It
has many things to say about "self forgetting", a mystery often mentioned in
the Bahá’í Writings.

# Emojis in Emacs intentionally disabled for OSX

This decision wasn't something "I approved of", in the sense you're thinking.
I do use a Mac, and I do miss my color emojis.

GNU Emacs is a project of the Free Software Foundation, and when they deem an
issue as relating to their political agenda, it trumps the technical purview
of the project maintainer. I keep Emacs going from a software point of view;
they keep the FSF going as a movement.

If RMS says that such a change relates to freedom, I can either acquiesce or
walk away. I didn't think color emojis were important enough to walk away. The
gcc/clang dispute was part of the reason the last maintainer walked away.

It's a free project. If a group of people is willing to put in the effort, you
could fork Emacs and make it into something better, freed from the FSF's
policies. Until that happens, expecting them to change by writing blog posts,
or commenting on Reddit, is not going to have any effect whatsoever.

# Do you have to believe that Baha'U'llah and his son Abdul Baha are free of contradictions?

One thing to keep in mind: By what standard do you judge one who lays claim to
a Revelation from God?

Bahá'u'lláh revealed Laws, and decided how and when they should be applied.
And not only did these Laws not appear until after a few decades, there are
even cases when He freed some of the believers from the obligation of
following them (e.g. Jamál-i-Burújirdí).

If Bahá'u'lláh decides when, and how, and to whom these Laws apply, are we
really to weigh His testimony in the balance of how we think He did or didn't
observe them?

> Therefore, should a person arise and bring forth a myriad verses,
  discourses, epistles, and prayers, none of which have been acquired through
  learning, what conceivable excuse could justify those that reject them, and
  deprive themselves of the potency of their grace? What answer could they
  give when once their soul hath ascended and departed from its gloomy temple?
  Could they seek to justify themselves by saying: “We have clung to a certain
  tradition, and not having beheld the literal fulfilment thereof, we have
  therefore raised such cavils against the Embodiments of divine Revelation,
  and kept remote from the law of God?”

# Compati

If I may hazard a thought:

The monks were divided among themselves over a cat, just as our minds over
reality. Nansen threatened to divide the cat as well if they could not
discover a good word to save it.

Joshu knew the answer lay, neither in forcing the monks together, nor the cat
apart -- that all such approaches are absurd. The only answer is to turn the
problem inside out (or upside down), and know there are neither monks nor
cats. A sword has no power to divide what admits of no division.

Nansen fears Joshu's sword in the verse, because it would end "Nansen". Nansen
enforced the edict by showing the monks the consequence of their thinking.

# Isn't the Bible pretty clear that the resurrection of Jesus was physical, and not just spiritual?

I wouldn't say "nearly all Christians" as if it were a universally held
belief. Jehovah's Witnesses certainly don't think so; the Wikipedia page on
The Resurrection of Christ gives several accounts of scholars who question
whether it was a physical event; and if you google for Christian thought on
the idea of a spiritual resurrection, you'll find others who think so too.

The clearest verses I've seen in support of a physical resurrection are those
where Christ demonstrates his wounds to the apostles (cf. John 20:27),
inviting them to even touch them. There is this article from a man who left
the Bahá’í Faith, because he thought these verses were so compelling. Yet, it
also says that a host of saints rose up from the cemetery and visited the
nearby city, being visible to many people; why is there no corroboration for
this?

Keep in mind when thinking about these things that every religion, every
religion, has been so certain about the validity of its interpretations that
it fully rejected the Faith that came after it. The Jews did this to Christ,
and still are. It's not because these Faiths are full of uneducated people who
cannot reason; they have compelling arguments behind the certitude of their
interpretations.

If someone thinks that John 20:27 is enough evidence to disprove the divine
origin of any Faith that claims otherwise, then I cannot convince them except
to argue by history: Humanity has chronically failed to interpret scripture,
and has used the "obviousness" of literal meanings to condemn and kill its
Messengers. It should be no surprise that this continues to the present day.

For a few other Bahá’í resources on this topic, there is this article by David
Friedman; and a discussion by David Young in The Resurrection of All Mankind.
Also, the Qur'án does not support the physical resurrection, so if we are to
clarify the Bahá’í position, we must consider that too.

# Three questions

First, the word mustaqarr can mean resting place, or where a thing abides. For
example, Ismailis say that the Imam is the mustaqarr (almost in the sense of
"repository", or "seat") of God's will.

What's interesting to me is that the sun does not move in relation to the
Earth, so it is always in its resting place. Similarly, the Primal Will may be
seen to go away and come again over the ages, but in truth He has always been
"from the beginning that hath no beginning, until the end that hath no end".

Second, I do not believe Bahá’u’lláh is encouraging people to eat meat, but is
saying we should not invent our own religious restrictions, beyond what God
has made unlawful -- a behavior that has plagued many past religions.

Third is a good question! Given how suddenly that topic appears within the
letter, it's as if ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is answering a specific question, in the
context of several other questions, but we are not seeing what those questions
were.

There was a discussion thread just recently on the question of Evolution and
science.

# A Man That Has Had a Dream: The Prophylactic Nature Of Zen Transmission

Perhaps saying "we are born with the ability to awaken" is stating things the
wrong way around. This makes it seem like enlightenment is some advanced state
of being, to which we all have a chance to aspire.

What if enlightenment is not something to be "achieved", but the cessation of
a certain kind of nonsense? Am I more advanced for recognizing that I hunt
after money, for no other reason than thinking money should be hunted after?
Or that I search for and prize enlightenment, without knowing what
"enlightenment" is -- since if I'm searching for it, how could I know?

jwiegley

Ironic that you should ask. ;) Where did your question arise from?

jwiegley

Nihilism is defined as “extreme skepticism maintaining that nothing in the world has a real
existence.” I think Zen appears to coincide when we talk about the role of mental conceptions, but
nihilism would stop short of statements like this from Huangpo:

    That which is called the Place of Precious Things is the real Mind, the original
    Buddha-Essence, the treasure of our own real Nature. These jewels cannot be measured or
    accumulated. Yet since there are neither Buddha nor sentient beings, neither subject nor
    object, where can there be a City of Precious Things? If you ask, ‘Well, so much for the City
    of Illusion, but where is the Place of Precious Things?’, it is a place to which no directions
    can be given. For, if it could be pointed out, it would be a place existing in space; hence, it
    could not be the real Place of Precious Things. All we can say is that it is close by. It
    cannot be exactly described, but when you have a tacit understanding of its substance, it is
    there.

To a nihilist, I don’t see them agreeing with anything being “there” at all, concerning both
Cities.

# merry no-christmas

r/zen
jwiegley

You’ve come to a place that is prone to argue only one side of this question, so I’ll play the
paradoxical devil’s advocate:

Belief answers a question, but faith is demonstrated by living it: through interaction with the
world and your community. Going to church isn’t only a restatement, any more than you’d stop seeing
a girlfriend just because you’ve already said you love her.

Lots of people here meditate and spend years of their life studying koans because they heard about
enlightenment or the Void or the Unborn and they want to strip away delusions and see it for
themselves. The fact that they expend this time and energy for the sake of something they’ve
neither seen nor experienced: this is faith. Otherwise, why waste a year of effort with no return?
Faith is acting on behalf of an Unknown, that you cannot know yet feel connected to.

Christ as found in the Gospels is quite different than what you see in churches, so I don’t blame
you if it feels stale and out of place there. If you study the lives of early Christian mystics, I
think you’d find a lot more in common with Zen than even most here would be willing to accept.

But it’s your existence and it’s worth exploring. Neither church nor r/zen are the places for
answers, but we’re happy to burrow into any set-doubt that could lead to a moment’s realization.

You might even find that Zen can make church an interesting subject of observation. Just watch out
for the feeling that you’ve achieved an elevated viewpoint above most others — which can lead to
many of the other behaviors you’ll find here too. Yet none of us know, because the mind isn’t the
tool of progress. We’re simply advocates of the ordinary, rather than believers in the
extraordinary.

I was thinking of something along these lines:

    All these phenomena are intrinsically void and yet this Mind with which they are identical is
    no mere nothingness. By this I mean that it does exist, but in a way too marvellous for us to
    comprehend. It is an existence which is no existence, a non-existence which is nevertheless
    existence. So this true Void does in some marvellous way ‘exist’. — Huangpo

jwiegley

Well, you’re no fun. :)

jwiegley

Do tell!

jwiegley

Is it the nothing that is Void — all things being Mind — or the nothing that divides between is and
is not? What somebody is reported to have said long ago is just an echo.

For example, in Arabic there is the nothingness of a candle held up to the sun; the nothingness of
a quiet room ripe for the least sound; and the nothingness of non-existence: both actual and

Greetings, AB!

Then we have two meanings at play: meaning through being (an Apple nourishes, independent of belief
or acknowledgement) and meaning through ascription. An interesting vein to explore.

    things have no meaning nor not no meaning...

We should retire this kind of non-speech. Silence communicates the exact same.

jwiegley

I call out whenever I see the baby going out with the bath water, since it’s such a common
interpretation around these parts. And now my comment returns to the void, even though we both are
changed. :)

jwiegley

    There is a point where a perceiving that nothing intrinisically matters might occur.

This still sounds like a nihilistic easy-way-out. Erasing all meaning from perception doesn’t mean
the dog doesn’t care if you feed him, or what you feed him. Taking a walk off a cliff has a
different meaning than down a garden path. Even the old worthies did not treat all goods as
fungible.

One side holds to Zen: Instant realization! The other grabs it tight: Quiet sitting!

The words aren’t trying to communicate information, but to prompt a sudden shift in perspective.
Sometimes a question is answered in a way intended to make the questioner realize the absurdity or
narrowness of their question.

Imagine a man is standing in a river complaining of thirst and asking what he should do. You shout
out, “Sleep on it!”

To an observer without context, it may deeply puzzle them what sleeping in this instance has to do
with finding water. But if the man in the river lies down, he’ll figure it out.

# Amazon

r/finance
jwiegley

“Price is what you pay, value is what you get.” — Buffet

Asking what Amazon is actually worth is a tricky question, because you also have to account for
future markets and growth and technological advances we haven’t seen yet. All this is part of the
price of a stock.

At the same time, people will pay for a stock based solely on what they think might happen (“it
will go up again!”) or what has happened recently (“it just went down!”).

I can’t tell you what Amazon should be priced at, or will be worth, in the near term or long term.
But I own plenty of their stock and like their business model, even if the stock market as a whole
is pricing things a bit optimistically.

At the end of the day you have to hit the books and understand all the numbers and their
implications, or you’ll be stuck with the analysis of others. There’s really no shortcut if you
want to invest in individual companies. Hence why so many choose indexed ETFs as a much simpler way
to share in the success of the US market.

happy in Python without knowing any of these things at all.

jwiegley

# Hey, Option Sellers!

r/options
jwiegley

It really depends on sector volatility and my general outlook on the market. If I really want to
own the stock no matter what, I’ll choose further out to increase premium, cashing out at 50-75%
profit before expiration if that should occur. If I’m betting on recovery after an exaggerated
earnings drop (or vice versa), I’ll choose a shorter timeframe because I’m betting on the short
term correction, but don’t have a solid idea of what performance will be over the next several
weeks.

I tend to sell puts at longer DTE than (covered) calls, because I find there’s more chance of
losing out on upside than the added premium accounts for. Market swings tend to outpace market
expectations in my preferred sector (technology).

jwiegley

Unless I misunderstand you, it’s closer to 5x. In a regular 2:1 margin account, you can’t borrow
more than the value of the marginable securities and cash that you own.

jwiegley

In the case of PM it means you can be invested in a stock, only having to “own” 15% of the value of

# Question about Leverage

r/options
jwiegley

Most investments (in stocks) aren’t likely to move much more than two standard deviations on a
given day, so some people calculate their require margin based on such a maximum daily drawdown
limit. This is how margin requirements are calculated for TD Ameritrade accounts that have
Portfolio Martin enabled.

For example, in Forex my leverage is 50:1, so I use $200 to control $10,000. There is a risk of
losing $9,800 more than my investment, but then again, major governments aren’t likely to collapse
all at once in a single day, so my computed margin risk is much lower, more like $3,000. However,
as the price moves against me, I may need to shore up the account to stay within that margin limit,
or else close out the position at the current loss.

jwiegley

5:1 means a 20% investment could turn into a full loss.

When you sell a deep in the money call, you are effectively selling at today’s price. The main

the highest delta you can get. If you’re right, you buy back the call and realize the profit. If
you’re wrong, you basically sold the stock, but won’t transfer the shares until expiration.

A CD is a Certificate of Deposit. It's effectively a promissory note from a bank to pay you back on

# Manifestation of God/Holy Spirit/Maid of Heaven Uncreated?

r/bahai
jwiegley

This is actually a fairly subtle point, as evidenced by the volume of words you've received in
response. It concerns the station of the Primal Will, and how it came into being. The Báb writes:

    Bear thou witness ... that verily God, glorified be He, hath ever been, and will ever exist
    without anything to exist with Him. He verily hath created all things by virtue of His Will
    (Mashiyyah), and hath created the Will by Itself, out of nothing else.... All things are
    created and affected by It.

When you think of God "creating" something, it necessarily binds the created with the Creator in a
relationship where both parties are existent: first there was one, now there are two. However, the
initial "sprinkling from the clouds of Unknowing" -- the origin of the Will -- does not follow this
mundane concept of creation, since in those terms we think of "firstness" and "beginning", yet the
Primal Will is independent of these. The Báb also writes:

    It is this Primal Will which appeareth resplendent in every Prophet and speaketh forth in every
    revealed Book. It knoweth no beginning, inasmuch as the First deriveth its firstness from It;
    and knoweth no end, for the Last oweth its lastness unto It.

I have no handy analogy to describe the Uncreated. Countless mystical books will take you to the
door of this thought, but remain silent thereafter. It defies all words and concepts:

    Such is the state of the wayfarers in this Valley; but the people of the Valleys above this see
    the end and the beginning as one; nay, they see neither beginning nor end, and witness neither
    “first” nor “last.” Nay rather, the denizens of the undying city, who dwell in the green garden
    land, see not even “neither first nor last”; they fly from all that is first, and repulse all
    that is last. For these have passed over the worlds of names, and fled beyond the worlds of
    attributes as swift as lightning. Thus is it said: “Absolute Unity excludeth all attributes.”
    And they have made their dwelling-place in the shadow of the Essence.

With that much time remaining, the odds of assignments are very low, since it's not worthwhile to

Of the many options I've sold, I've only faced early exercise once. According to the OIC:

    Option holders only exercise about 7% of options. The percentage hasn't varied much over the

    that, in general, option exercises are not that common.

# Is ETFs apocalypse possible?

r/StockMarket
jwiegley

EFTs can fail, in which case the assets remaining are divided and paid out. From one source on the
Web:

    Eric Balchunas, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, notes that during the past five
    years, 1,050 ETFs have launched. During the same period, more than 900 ETFs have folded. Their
    average lifespan is just 3.4 years.

On ETFs folding:

    Like mutual funds, ETFs may fall under duress if it can no longer validate the expense of
    operations through investor fees. As an ETF loses assets, the fund will lose investors,
    increasing the cost of operating per investor. If the fund is not able to recover the lost
    interest, it may have to close down. Nevertheless, the closing of an ETF is an orderly and
    efficient process, and investors are given plenty of warning so they can act accordingly.

    Before providers close the shutters on their ETFs, investors are notified three to four weeks
    prior to the stop date, and in the meantime, the ETF will still operate as usual during normal
    trading hours. In the event a firm shuts down an ETF, investors have one of two choices: sell
    your position before the final trading date, or wait for the fund to close and the check to
    come in. This can create tax consequences, and no investor likes surprises.

However, you won't be able to sell one of these; it will be a debit strategy, hence the increased
maximum loss.

jwiegley

This is called a credit spread. You earn the credit for the sale, with your risk being the
difference between the strikes. For example, if it expires lower, you’d owe ($110-$105)*100-credit.

# Questions on Covered Calls

r/thinkorswim
jwiegley

Say you have 100 XYZ that you bought at $100. Then you sell a call at $110 for, say, $0.90. You
collect $90 premium, and this is yours to keep.

If the stock is anywhere under $110, nothing happens and you're $90 richer. If it's $110 or above,
the contract will expire and your broker will assign you the CALL, which means they'll sell your
shares at $110. You keep $90 + $10 * 100, or $1,090. This is your max possible profit on this
equity+option position: No matter how much higher than $110 the shares go, you still only get
$1,090.

A few weeks ago I bought 1k shares of BAC, and then sold 10 CALL contracts ATM, expecting it to go
lower. Well, it didn't. I had to watch the value of those shares reach over $4k without being able
to sell (because I didn't want to hold naked call options). In the end I made $90 off that trade,
but whoever bought the call from me made several thousand. But this is how it goes.

# Can anyone explain Forex market trading?

r/investing
jwiegley

Forex is legit, but there’s a disproportionate amount of total nonsense about it on the Web. I had
a hard time finding solid, reliable information about how to use Forex within a larger portfolio.
The great majority of what I encountered was snake oil: promising massive returns while failing to
mention that the losses could be just as massive.

What’s good and bad about Forex:

Leverage is great, so you don’t need to allocate a lot of capital, but use stop losses (or stop
limits) and cap your account size to maximum risk tolerance (a flash crash could result in
liquidation and closure, though it’s fairly rare).

There are no transaction fees and holding long/short are mostly equivalent: except that you pay (or
earn) interest for holding overnight. Right now, being long 50k GBP/USD costs ~$10/day.

There is volatility, but it’s usually pretty slow and is sometimes range bound, so you might see
your investment gyrate around 0 for several days. It’s nice knowing that your investment is
extremely unlikely to fall to zero. You’re betting on governments now, not companies. However,
leverage means that it could fall more than your total capital allotted.

While technical analysis is still useful, I find that you have to be a LOT more informed to
understand Forex movements. Many things can impact prices, in ways that defy a trivial analysis.
You’ll want to learn about the central banks, economics, commodity markets, the major economic
health indicators, and political news.

It’s not “free money” by any means, the way some YouTube people make it out to be. If anyone is
telling you they 4x’d their account in a year, best to ignore them. Or ask why they think the ECB
is being so expansionist in a time of decent wage stability, and see if they have as much to say
then.

# FOREX

r/investing
jwiegley

When an event is this well expected beforehand, it’s not likely to cause a crash unless it happens
in a surprising way. There’s already a lot of shorting of pounds happening, which would mean plenty
of buying to cover after the fact.

To trade the market, you don’t trade the event, but the participants. What are the buyers and
sellers likely to do, and why? What is the Bank of England going to do after? Is that being priced
in?

No trading decision is ever obvious in advance. The only times you’ll know exactly what to do are
in the heat of the moment, when you notice something that other retail traders might be slow to
catch on to. But if it’s far in advance, the best you can do is formulate a plan and define your
risk limits. If you could be certain about such things, you’d have won the game.

Just guessing here, but since I’m assuming you didn’t have ~$7 million to secure the put, they sold
protection for capital to close the ITM short. However, the other side didn’t exercise all of its
contracts to sell. As the option holder, they can decide how many contracts to close, but your
broker didn’t know it would be a partial closure before selling protection. Now it would seem
you’re short 10,200 shares, and should buy to cover at the earliest opportunity, Monday pre-market.

I would think the lack of closure is due to your contracts being spread among several individuals,
some of whom had higher exercise costs than $0.03/contract would net them.

forces, news, earnings reports, the actions of institutional investors, people’s opinions, Twitter,

tomorrow, which could generate a buy or sell impulse. Multiply this by millions, and the fact that
such buying and selling itself influences the market. It’s a huge feedback loop based on real and
imagined events, rational and irrational behavior, hopes and fears. In the aggregate this leads to
trends for a variety of reasons, and certain patterns that investors attempt to capitalize on.

# Making money selling options

r/options
jwiegley

There are a few strategies for making money selling options:

- Sell cash secured puts to buy stock. You always make money doing this, though you may hold stock
at lower than market afterward. So pick a stock that's worth it.

- Sell put credit spreads at high (relative) IV when things are rising or neutral. If you're
probability is 70%, and it's priced right, you'll make, for example, $300 7/10 times, and lose $700
3/10 times. However, probabilities are over-estimated by the market. Back-testing research done by
Option Alpha shows that the actual probability _over time_ is nearer 83%. Is this pulling pennies
from a steamroller? Maybe, if you were expecting huge returns from every trade. But it can be
consistent income.

- Sell call credit spreads at high (relative) IV when things are falling or neutral.

- Sell straddles if you expect movement, rolling for credit when you need more time.

- Sell covered calls on stock that you're assigned, if you expect fluctuation under your break-even
price (which in turn effectively adjusts the cost basis downward). In markets like the one we have
now, I sell and close covered calls on the same equities several times a week.

The thing with selling premium is that several factors work in your favor: vega, theta, and
neutrality in the underlying (in addition to beneficial movement). In the case of CSP and CC, your
worst outcomes are stock ownership, or exiting at breakeven. You're exchanging open-ended profit
for a wider range of successful outcomes.

# Do y'all have a general rule as to when to sell your earnings straddles?

r/options
jwiegley

Having a strategy is essential: Not only because it defines your risk and probabilities, but also
because it defines the meaning of success and failure.

If your strategy is to make 50% on a straddle, and you get out at 50%, that's all you need to know.
Count your win. And if you're going to count your missed gains, be sure to also count your missed
losses, and weigh them against each other.

Maybe... your strategy can be improved to either increase the win rate, or increase profit sizes.
But before making such a change, backtest to see if the increased risk really wins in the long run.

Nearly all of my major losses have resulted from allowing emotion -- fear, greed, over-confidence,
bias -- to undermine my chosen strategy. So much so that nowadays, I don't count my wins in terms
of dollars; I count them in terms of holding to my strategy throughout the trade, since doing so
consistently has always generated better returns in the long run than rolling the dice.

If you have a date you want the money by, say 2050, then Fidelity (and probably other companies)
offer mutual funds that are geared towards this sort of approach.

For example, if saving for 30 years from now, you could put the money into the 2050 index fund (the
non-managed version) monthly, which Fidelity then invests in ~80% stocks and ~20% other asset
classes. As the years roll by, they'll automatically shift the portfolio towards more and more
stable assets. By 2050, the fund is mostly bonds or treasuries or money market, expecting that
you'll want a stable money supply by that time rather than growth.

Since it's a mutual fund you can withdraw at any time, but it might be a reasonable place to stuff
your money while you're learning. Otherwise, just browse the ETF market and pick something around
your desired risk tolerance.

where the renter stopping paying for six month straight. Finally we forgave the debt just to get
them to leave. Consider the human side too; and consider property management companies as a way to
buffer yourself from it.

# Which expiration date to buy?

r/options
jwiegley

If you have the capital, go _at least_ 60 days out, otherwise you're racing against the clock as
your option suffers from theta decay quicker each day. I made such a mistake recently, and am
preparing to book the loss in a week or two. Usually the only reason I would buy near expiry is
that my belief is high and the premium is low enough that I'm willing to give it up (which usually
ends up being the case). Otherwise, I prefer far out LEAPs (Jan/Jun 21), which give me lots of time
to ride out fluctuations — even major market moves that take months to resolve.

# Investing in gold for the upcoming recession

Looking at the prices on https://www.macrotrends.net/1333/historical-gold-prices-100-year-chart,
it's interesting that gold was in $300s for a long time, then bumped into a range that was double,
then triple, and now ~4x for the last ten years. Who knows how much higher it could go up, though
it doesn't tend to only go down for a few years before returning higher. Some articles you might

# Recession fears, recession reality

r/investing
jwiegley

You're right, losses are the price of education — if we learn and improve our principles and
strategies. I've had a few such experiences this year, and each was a vastly better teacher than my
successes. You might even say one cannot become a solid investor without loss; it's as bad weather
to a sailor.

Though I'm not sure I'd say it's not a loss until you pull out. It's definitely a loss in terms of
market value. Whether you believe it's still a worthwhile investment is a another question, and if
you think it's not anymore, the money is perhaps better transferred elsewhere. Or put this way: If
you lose $10k in value and hold, you have to believe your asset is capable of making at least $10k.
For a company with good fundamentals and track record, I usually have little trouble believing
that.

jwiegley

If you have time to wait, for example if you don't need your money in the next ten to twenty years,
then an index ETF, or a blended mutual fund, is a reasonable way to go. Even if everything goes
crazy in the next 5 years and the market loses half its value, in the long run we're all betting
that civilization to continue to grow and develop. The top investors in the world aren't ceasing to
invest at times like this; but they aren't focusing their investments on market timing either. Even
though we had two big recessions in the past twenty years, if you had put money into Apple and
Microsoft at basically any point, and just held it out, you'd be doing great right now. The key is
not to panic, use dollar cost averaging to your advantage, and don't worry too much about money you
don't need to spend right away.

jwiegley

Good point. I don't remember the "pre-recession" times quite nearly as well, probably due to the
prevailing europhia.

You might invest in a runner by training him, providing clothes, food, housing, so that over many

You speculate on a race by betting on the runner you think will win. You gamble if you do it

You can speculate on companies after research. I think of it like this: you invest in companies,
you speculate on the market.

Gold has value because people think it does, its scarce, and its not going anywhere. It's not a

# Advice on long term strategy?

A good principle: don't let your money follow your greed. You already have enough investment to
profit nicely if it returns to 20 or higher. I'd leave things be and find more stable investments
to diversify your portfolio.

Thinking of how much more you could make by buying in at 3.50 and then 3 is a mentality that will
drain away your savings. They call it "throwing good money after bad".

You don't have to make all your profits in one place. The market is full of opportunities. Get
better at finding them, rather than betting the farm on a single play.

# Out of the money options give more profit?

r/options
jwiegley

Theta meas that if you buy an option expiring soon, and SPY stays the same, your option will decay
in value to zero just from the passage of time. Time (or theta) decay accelerates toward
expiration, but is fairly flat up to 30-60 days prior. Also, time decay hurts you most if you buy
near the money options, since that is when it is highest in relation to the overall price of the
option.

# How do calls and puts work, why do people make or lose huge amounts on them, and are they worth

r/investing
jwiegley

Buying calls and puts gives you leverage. For $1000 you could potentially make much, much more.
People lose lots of money when they get intoxicated by this leverage, and put down their whole life
savings for a potential huge return. Yet if the stock doesn't move the way you expect it to, your
options expire worthless and you lose everything.

A friend of mine tripled his total capital buying options. He then proceeded to lose everything he
had gained.

There are saner, far safer ways to use options, and lots you should be aware of before entering a
given option position. Not every use of options is equivalent to rolling dice.

The question is whether you can profit during local turbulence. With options there are ways to
profit in nearly every type of market, up, down or sideways. Don’t withhold investing because
things might go down, or might go up. Learn how to profit when others are uncertain. Invest in
value, rather than a particular market condition, provided you have the time to be patient.

# Opportunity costs and Buy-Hold

r/investing
jwiegley

Another thing you can do is sell and repurchase downward. That is, if you buy at a high and the
underlying crashes — and you see a trend that's likely, in your belief, to continue downward — then
sell half. If it goes down further, buy back in and adjust your cost basis. If it keeps going up,
count the loss today and wait longer to recoup, or decide it's too uncertain and shift to another
investment. I just did this with AMZN while writing this.

Money you lose is fully gone, realized or not. The only question to ask yourself is if you believe
the asset you hold still has value. If it does, and you think you can make money on it, *that's the
sole reason to keep holding it*. Thus, at the start of each day -- say you're down $10k -- ask
yourself, "Will my current holdings earn me $10k, or should I be investing elsewhere?" If you think
that lost $10k is "yours" and is sitting somewhere waiting to come back to you, this is what leads
you to sunk cost thinking and missed opportunities.

It can work, if you’re patient. I wouldn’t say it’s automatic wealth, but I can tell you that I buy
puts against VIX every time it spikes, and it’s made consistent money several times in a row

# Could a recession still happen if everyone is waiting for it?

r/investing
jwiegley

During a bubble, when growth is sky high, there is more spending on credit than on cash generated
from productivity. This must at some point lead to a time when more money is spent on reducing debt
than on purchases. Since much of that money will come from selling assets that were likely bought
at higher price, it can depress the market at scale, and lead to a constant decrease in growth as
the economy corrects for earlier inflationary spending.

Ray Dalio has an excellent introductory video on this process, if you Google for “dalio economic
machine”.

Selling covered calls is best in a neutral market, in my opinion. If it goes up too much, you keep
premium but lose out on growth. If it goes down too much, you keep premium but now have unrealized
losses against your position. If it stays sideways, you’ve won premium when otherwise you’d just be
biding your time.

# Path to learning options

r/options
jwiegley

Correct. You receive the premium from your buyer.

jwiegley

Yes, there is a catch: no one will want to buy that option, so it’s price would be $0.00.

Your platform should tell you what the market’s expected point move is at expiration. For a 90
point move, you’ll have to go out many months, maybe even years, depending on the stock.

If you ever feel that an option contract is “certain”, then it’s usually also worthless, because
that’s part of how the prices are determined. People pay you a premium when they believe you’re
taking on more risk than they are.

In the case of your “90 point move tomorrow”, you could write the option, but I think your limit
sell would just expire with no buyers. They would see it as throwing money away, unless they knew
something.

If you’re selling a call on stock that you own and it’s bullish, you will sell the stock. You
always keep the premium, no matter what. If you’re selling a call and you don’t own the stock, and
you’re bullish... then I’m not sure if you know the risk profile of writing naked calls. Perhaps
you could say more, because I feel that I don’t have the whole picture.

In general you’d buy a call if you’re bullish, sell a call if you’re bearish or neutral, and the
reverse for puts. Selling puts carries the risk of assigning stock, while selling calls carries the
risk of having to sell stock (which, if you don’t already have it, is potentially unlimited risk).

# Beginner question about calls

r/options
jwiegley

Delta is a measure of how much the price of your asset will change with every point move in the
underlying. Stock has a delta of 1, so a point of movement is a point of increase or decrease in
value. Gamma measures how much delta will change after each such movement.

Deep in the money options can also have a delta of 1. In this case, you’re buying them for leverage
— meaning, you can experience 1000 shares worth of movement for what 50 shares might cost, for
example — or to take advantage of increases in volatility, which can also affect the value of
options. The trade off is that you might be wrong, and the option expires worthless, losing all of
your money. This is always the maximum risk for buying options, so avoid over-committing, no matter
how much you think the stock will move in your favor. Or, if you like that sort of thing, head over
to r/WallStreetBets.

If this seems too complicated, then definitely, buy and sell stock. In fact, find really good
companies, and during big market downturns like we just had, buy stock and hold it. There are many
examples of this working out wonderfully.

Options can be quite complex, but they offer tremendous flexibility, and can allow you to profit
safely — that is, with fixed risk — in every kind of market: bull, bear or neutral. You can create
positions that will work to your advantage in a majority of outcomes, and where you even have a
decent chance of knowing the probabilities in advance. I roughly do half of my trading in options
(buying and selling), a lot of stock, options on futures, and then futures themselves. They all
have their strengths and weaknesses, and demand study and sticking to well-formulated strategies,
or else you’re much better off putting it in a mutual fund and walking away.

jwiegley

You can also pay less premium by buying deep in the money, which also has higher delta. This allows
you to profit off smaller moves and exit the position early, if something changes your mind. I’ve
used this strategy many times now: buying deep in the money LEAP calls.

I'd suggest you create two accounts: one at a brokerage containing $5k, and another where you

the temptation to transfer the money over. You'll know what I mean when you reach that day. :)

Once you can achieve better returns, percentage-wise, from your $5k than from your ETF, that's when
you should consider taking over management of it all. Just keep studying and practicing until you
do.

Do you like the companies on their own merit? If so, then in your situation (and I've been there a
few times now), I switch mentality from Day Trader to Investor. Day Trader me looks at immediate
gains/losses, but Investor me sees the equity as a longer-term growth investment, where daily
fluctuations in unrealized gains/losses are largely immaterial. It's really two different
strategies.

For example, last week I sold puts against NFLX and was hammered. And then hammered again. But hey,
I wanted to buy NFLX or I wouldn't have sold the put, and I so settled in for a long autumn. Turns
out I only had to wait two days for the rebound, but mentally I was preparing for mid-2020.

It depends on my thoughts about the underlying. I'll typically put in a limit sale for a target

close.

Today I hit my target on an AMZN LEAP call but waited too long to see it raise higher. I was trying
out a tweak to my strategy, where usually I exit early, but this time tried being patient with a
winner. This just reinforced to me that you shouldn't change strategy mid-game. If I had really
intended to invest "to hold out for a winner", I would have bought a further expiration.

jwiegley

Welcome. :) And congrats on picking a winner out of the gate!

I would just say, watch out for the siren song of long calls/puts, promising easy profits. When you
sell put options against capital, you can win in many directions: up, sideways, little bit down,
theta decay, drop in imp vol; but you when go long a call, you really need it to either go up, or
for volatility to increase. The potential profits are way bigger, sure, but you're as likely to
guess wrong as right.

That's great, I was wondering just the other day if such a summary existed.

# Bought my first puts (FitBit) and need some guidance

r/options
jwiegley

If you bought puts at $4, and fit bit is now $3.65, then you have a few options (really, no pun
intended):

 1. Tomorrow, sell to close, since these put options are In The Money (ITM).

 2. Wait until August 9 if you think it will continue to go down.

There may be after-market activity today (9 minutes left) or pre-market tomorrow, that could move
fitbit back above $4, in which case you can only do the latter. Also, your profit at the moment
depends on the price of the options, so I couldn't say without knowing that.

Personally, I would get out early, count it as a good start, and then hit the books before you try
again. You'll learn that buying puts/calls with short expiration times is very close to gambling,
and is not the surest way to invest your money. If you're going to buy an option, buy it as far out
as you can afford, for several reasons. I sometimes buy them in mid-2021 if they're available at a
price I'm OK with, and sell them once I reach my profit goal or loss limit.

Also, make sure you know your profit goal and loss limit, and how to achieve them, and how the
options works toward both of these. I highly recommend: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=el10dgDa2Do

# Where are your loss limits?

r/options
jwiegley

Depends on how fast the asset moves, and what range I need to wait out. Certainly never more than
2% in a single trade, preferably much less. But then, I'm not after big gainers unless I see
something special.

# FEYE covered call

Yes, this. An owned stock that continues to oscillate beneath your strike is a golden goose who

# Capital Management and the Wheel

r/options
jwiegley

Also keep an eye on the "Probability of OTM". If you want only 2 out of 10 positions to be
assigned, make trades at 80% Prob. OTM -- which also assumes no surprise news events.

I use the wheel every trading day, and close out early whenever a put or CC reaches 50% profit. I
would recommend this strategy for small, consistent income at well-defined risk.

# Alternative

r/options
jwiegley

I trade options because they can offer a small, fixed risk. Futures seem riskier to me, since I
don't know when the stop loss will take me out, whereas with options I'm purchasing the time window
and maximum loss up front.

# Any good trading preferably options podcasts?

I like Options Alpha too.

# Down 60% on KSS puts. Sell or wait?

r/options
jwiegley

I don't know what your capital situation is, but if you think it will continue to move against you,
you could buy shares. This will reduce profits if it starts dropping in price -- or, you sell the
puts in that case and hold the shares -- but will soften the blow if it continues moving upward.
Then worst case is that it doesn't move for five months and you lose all your time value on top of
the 60%.

r/options

Of the ~100 stocks in my watch list, BYND makes the least sense to me. I want to own it for the

be happy with.

As a result, I hang back and watch as time and again, it jumps >10% in a single day. It’s like
watching kids play outside my window while I’m hard at work.

# Tips & tricks

r/options
jwiegley

I would suggest starting out by selling cash secured puts on stocks you want to buy. Don’t think of
it as trading options yet, but a fancier kind of LIMIT BUY.

If you get assigned, then once the stock rises back to near your previous strike, sell a covered
call a few points above as a fancier kind of LIMIT SELL.

Going through this cycle, pay attention to how your options move and why. Learn about what changes
the value of an option, and when is a good time to buy back, and when to hold until expiration. I
recommend initially trading weeklies or near expiration options, as the amounts will be smaller and
you don’t have to wait so long for expiration.

This is not a get rich quick scheme. You will make small money, with small risk, and it may be
several days before you realize those gains. But it’s a fairly safe way to get a feel for options,
using a strategy that, at worst, leaves you either owning stock you wanted, or missing out on
surprise upside from time to time.

Just don’t over-extend, don’t buy options initially, and avoid complicated spreads that promise
high probability small returns but with outsized relative risk. You can branch into those areas
after you study the Greeks, and how they relate to market conditions and the news cycle.

Each week I sell many options, on stocks that I would choose to own and hold at almost any price,
and I buy back the options to realize profits as quickly as I can. My strategic goal is a
fractional portfolio percentage of realized returns each day, and I really don’t try to exceed this
(which, as a result, I often do, though unexpectedly). Small and steady is the rule, based on
companies I know, like and trust, and thus far this has produced a high enough win rate that
trading has been both fun and worthwhile.

# Can I believe in ghosts and still be a Baha'i?

No one can stop you from believing anything you want, while being a Bahá'í. It comes down to what
you do, and there are only a few laws that every active member must observe. There is no law
against believing in ghosts.

In fact, even what people call "God" is a belief of their own making. What makes it "right" is if
it propels it us toward an ever deeper relationship with that Unknowable Entity.

I don't what ghosts mean to you, or how it factors into your life choices, but as long as it isn't
harming the unity or good name of the Faith, don't let people discourage you. Your own studies into
the Holy Writings are what ought form your opinions about the afterlife, and not the knowledge of

# Credit Spreads Anybody ?

jwiegley

Isn't 5% quite a bit? If I take a %5 loss, I need a 5.2% gain to get back to even. If I ever have a
losing streak, it could quickly become quite difficult to claw one's way back.

I prefer to risk much less per trade, more like 0.25% when buying options (as directional
speculation), and mainly selling puts so I end up a stock owner when things go wrong, which I then
sell covered calls on (and buy the back) as the market fluctuates under my price target. Strangles
and verticals are also good.

# Newbie "Straddle Options" Question

r/options
jwiegley

If you're confident that the underlying will rebound, and you have the capital and patience to
wait, then you could sell an ATM/OTM put on TSLA expiring at the end of the week. If TSLA goes up,
you made some cash; if it tanks enough, you now own TSLA at a discount to today's prices, and just
have to wait.

I did that for NFLX this week, and it discounted the stock enough that the rebound doesn't have to
be very much to break even.

The danger with this is that we're not always in a bull market that bounces back so easily. You
could be stuck in that issue for months/years, or just end up taking a loss. You never know when
that might happen, so just plan accordingly.

I completely agree that the math and flexibility of options -- plus the ability to make consistent

equities. Some days that works great, other days your capital is suddenly frozen for six months to
a year as you wait for a market rebound! I like knowing up front what my "escape" amount will be,
plus the fact that the options themselves have a market, so I almost never have to wait until
expiration.

# Theorizing Adjustments Strategy For Credit Spreads

r/options
jwiegley

Assuming the short leg you sold was initially ATM/OTM, wouldn't buying the new long leg under it --
which is now ITM -- cost much more than the premiums you gained? It sounds like you're creating a
synthetic covered call, with the upper long call no longer being needed. Indeed, if I check the
risk profile for your scenario in TOS, it goes from:

Before (short call, upper long call):

______
      \
---------------
        \
         \
          \_________

After (lower long call, middle short call, upper long call):

                   /
           _______/
          /
-------------------
        /
_______/

Instead of limiting your downside, as the upper long call was doing before, it has switched to
seeking further upside should the underlying cross that strike. So, I'd sell it to cover the cost
of the lower.

If you think you've found relatively easy money, I'd backtest it on issues with similar properties

There are enough variables at play here that accurately predicting risk is tricky, which is why I'd
avoid it: you're not just banking on the price of the underlying, but also that other factors will
hold steady over the period -- like your ability to sell calls at a high enough premium regularly.
The real risk, I'd say, is that you'll do incredibly well, chalking it up to strategy rather than
unrepeatable fortune, which leads you to wager too much the next time around.

# Noob Safe Haven Thread | July 08-14 2019

r/options
jwiegley

These are great questions. On the first one:

Bear in mind that things have been pretty bullish lately, which tends to offer many opportunities
to buy back puts at a profit. However, there may soon come a time when things turn bearish, in
which case you could pursue a similar strategy selling calls (if IV is high), or buying puts. Also,
are you using spreads to protect your downside, or were you hoping for positions in those ETFs at a
discount?

Most times you can find opportunities to use all of these strategies. So, rather than thinking that
it's the strategy that's winning for you, let it be your consistency, willingness to adapt, and
general circumspection.

For example, to your second question, do you know the probability of profit on those trades? Are
you OK with the possible outcomes? Usually when I'm buying or selling, puts or calls, I look for a
trade that leaves me in a good position for the largest number of scenarios. For example, I like
writing puts when I'm bullish on a stock, because I want to own it -- but at a cheaper price -- yet
I also want to profit if it keeps going up. I buy close enough to the money in hopes of a
fluctuation forcing assignment. If IV goes up with no movement, I just wait. Here my "worst case"
is the reduction in buying power until expiration, so I only sell out a month or two. On the other
hand, buying calls without a good reason is something I rarely do, since a drop in IV or a drop in
the underlying can stall me out, until I'm just wasting time value, leaving me with nothing to show
for it in the end but a loss. In such cases, if I really believe in the stock, I'd prefer to buy
the security outright and weather the storms.

# Wondering how Many of us are Buyers vs Sellers

r/options
jwiegley

Buying and selling shouldn't be about the investor, but the market. If you sell when IV is high,
and buy when it's low, you take advantage of the market's over-estimations.

I highly recommend watching https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej_6uiQCjRE, starting at 7:17. He talks
about this very point, and how IV can affect buying and selling outcomes.

# Covered call help best course of action

r/options
jwiegley

When selling a covered call, I consider these three things:

 1. Own a stock you _want_ to hold long. For any of my covered stocks, I'd be perfectly happy
    holding them for years if need be.

 2. Choose a strike price that you want to exit the position at, as firmly as you might consider a
    LIMIT sell position.

 3. Choose a profit amount that, such that if the stock dips, you buy back the call.

If you do this, there is no remorse. If the stock holds neutral, you get premium; if the stock goes
up, you've sold at a price you already wanted to sell at; if the stock drops, you reap profit
(small but steady) on the difference.

For stocks that slowly fluctuate under your target price, you can keep repeating this strategy to
make money often.

But if you ever find yourself with buyer's remorse, or regretting your choices, then you need to
revise your plan, not your position.

Tolerance in this instance is an interesting thing to dig into. Not to be corny, but part of the
answer may be that line from the matrix: “There is no spoon.” The dog barking isn’t an external
reality imposing on your thoughts and emotions; it’s a physical event (pressure waves in the air)
causing an internal experience (sound) which is interpreted by a model of the world (dog, owner,
sleep, future, etc). Of all these, the model is what’s driving your emotional response. It’s
possible to experience the same anxiety just by believing that the dog might start barking, for
example. Or by dreaming about it.

Among its other aspects, Zen is great at bringing you face to face with the existence, operation,
and unreality of the models we use to interface with life. Emotionally and mentally, we live with a
bone box sitting on our shoulders. But it’s we who have accepted this narrative of separation, and
thus contrast and opposition.

Maybe the dog is also you.

jwiegley

Good response. Anyone here who isn’t plagued by dog barking should pause before offering wisdom.

My own dog nemesis, it seems, must have perished. It’s been quiet for the past year. But when he
was there, I would seek the origin of my discontent. Is it the sound, the disruption, the anxiety
of it never ending, my expectation...?

People who want enlightenment in order to feel special will also need to believe it’s rare and

# Zen Minds Assemble! Thoughts and a question regarding a strange bit of dualism...

r/zen

I would say that "mountain" is a signifier, a symbol standing for an idea.

Initially, "mountains are mountains" identifies the idea with what is referred to. That, over
there, _is_ a mountain. Just getting people to let go of this ideational identification is
supremely difficult. "What do you mean that's not a tree? obviously it is." (I'm quoting a recent
conversation).

When mountains are not mountains, the signifier loses existential value. Now you don't know what
the hell that thing over there is. Maybe it's a lake bed that moved long ago.

When mountains are once again mountains the signifier has utility again, but no reality. It just
points at something, when the need today is to plan a hiking trip.

I personally don't think Zen is mysterious or esoteric at all. What's esoteric is how we name
everything in the world, and then give those names power over our capacity to think and see and
feel. Any perceived complexity, or difficulty, or "skill", is like a person who's made a huge knot
out of a piece of string, and then must untie it.

# Zen is not Present-Mindedness

When focusing on the present is a matter of willing yourself away from all that is not present (and

# After a certain point in study and practice, does Zen negate itself?

r/zen
jwiegley

It's taken me a while to respond. I've thought over your question for some time now, but am afraid
there is no answer to give.

It is just what is before you. Yet the problem with ideas is that every term carries a host of
negations hidden within it. If I say "the present", your mind conjures up "not present" to compare
it with, in order to understand. If I say "here", it gives birth to "not there". This inverse image
-- the contrast, the context -- is purely mind. It's why, when we look at a book, we don't also see
kindling, or a doorstop or a frisbee. Seeking to know "book", the rest is blotted out. Only the
name without negation is true, but owing to how human language and thinking work, mind can't know
that name.

It doesn't mean we can't break through, though. Even if some dislike the term "faith", there is a
power we have to step across the bridge, not only despite our limitations, but enriched by them.

I thought you might also enjoy this passage from an ancient Sufi text, where the Simurgh is used as
a symbol of Reality:

It was in China, late one moonless night,
The Simorgh first appeared to mortal sight --
He let a feather float down through the air,
And rumours of its fame spread everywhere;
Throughout the world men separately conceived.
An image of its shape, and all believed
Their private fantasies uniquely true!
(In China still this feather is on view,
Whence comes the saying you have heard, no
doubt, ‘Seek knowledge, unto China seek it out.’)
If this same feather had not floated down,
The world would not be filled with His renown --
It is a sign of Him, and in each heart
There lies this feather’s hidden counterpart.
But since no words suffice, what use are mine
To represent or to describe this sign?
Whoever wishes to explore the Way,
Let him set out -- what more is there to say?”

it, railing against an "unfair" existence in the hopes Reality would make our problems just go
away. Just as our parents responded to our suffering and fixed it, we then internalized the
principle.

I hope you get well soon. Illness is no fun at all -- no matter the transience of perception!

The understanding I've shared is not mine, but something I've sought to fathom most of my life now.
The inhabitants of r|zen seem generally allergic to religion, so I avoid speaking of such things
here, but since you asked the question, consider this my indication. And there is far more down
this rabbit hole.

    And when this stage of the journey is completed and the wayfarer hath soared beyond this lofty
    station, he entereth the City of Divine Unity, and the garden of oneness, and the court of
    detachment. In this plane the seeker casteth away all signs, allusions, veils, and words, and
    beholdeth all things with an eye illumined by the effulgent lights which God Himself hath shed
    upon him. In his journey he seeth all differences return to a single word and all allusions
    culminate in a single point. Unto this beareth witness he who sailed upon the ark of fire and
    followed the inmost path to the pinnacle of glory in the realm of immortality: "Knowledge is
    one point, which the foolish have multiplied." This is the station that hath been alluded to in
    the tradition: "I am He, Himself, and He is I, Myself, except that I am that I am, and He is
    that He is."

And these two verses, which actually led me to this forum, to help approach the meaning of
awareness without self:

    How can a true lover continue to exist when once the effulgent glories of the Beloved are
    revealed? How can the shadow endure when once the sun hath shone forth? How can a devoted heart
    have any being before the existence of the Object of its devotion? Nay, by the One in Whose
    hand is my soul! In this station, the seeker's complete surrender and utter effacement before
    his Creator will be such that, were he to search the East and the West, and traverse land, sea,
    mountain and plain, he would find no trace of his own self or of any other soul.

    This is the plane whereon the vestiges of all things are destroyed in the traveler, and on the
    horizon of eternity the Divine Face riseth out of the darkness, and the meaning of "All on the
    earth shall pass away, but the face of thy Lord...." is made manifest.

These were all written by Bahá'u'lláh, around the late 1850s. He indicates a direct connection
between this and what animated the Buddha's awakening, though I don't expect much sympathy to that
view here. Yet, how do we know the Zen writings have any truth either? You put such things to use,
and see what results. The tree is known by its fruits.

I agree completely. Insight should lead to seeing that all arise from the same source. Even if
differences appear, we are like cells of one body, leaves of one tree, or the waves of the same
ocean.

To that end, seeing another person directly should cause you to feel their joy and sorrow as your
own. Even if one is free from the cycle of birth and death (of the ever-varying self), your
compassion would be keener, not less.

When some look down on others, or disregard them, I doubt their veracity. Even when I treat your
ideas of the world as so many straw dogs waiting for the flame, your heart is as mine, beating in
another chest.

jwiegley

There is the object-as-it-is, and the object-as-perceived. The second object and the subject are
one. The first is independent, which explains why “all is One” won’t stop you from getting hit by a
bus.

Zen brushes away the false reality of the object-as-perceived. Rather than seeing ourselves as a
single point of awareness within a sea of perceptions, we come to realize we are all of that
experience.

Which leaves the question: what is reality-as-it-is? No conception can answer this question nor
anything be said of it. It is the oak tree in the garden; but don’t for a moment think that it’s
the “oak tree in the garden”!

So I think there is no such thing as “accurate perception”. There can only be direct experience.
Perception is like slicing an orange: although cutting it reveals something about the orange, no
amount of cutting represents the whole orange.

    We have to draw the line somewhere if we're going to get anywhere.

I’d say you’ve struck gold in this sentence: Drawing a line is the very essence of duality, that we
feel it absolutely justified for the sake of utility.

Except that “metal” — in the way we think of it — is already somewhat bogus.Imagine almost any
property you associate with metals, and there is a metal without that property. The only thing they
all have in common is a certain mobility of electrons, a trait once again beneath the realm of
direct observation.

The metal you’re thinking of is in your mind: it is your mind, representing itself as the world. It
is an artificial notion (however approximate), whose specious accuracy causes you to miss the
universe hiding in that little “spoon”.

    Split the atom’s heart and lo!

What is before you when you face it without names or designations or lines? What can you see that

a mystery so great, it hides by its very ubiquity.

jwiegley

    That's when it hit me - there IS no spoon! There's just a piece of metal - silver or steel or
    whatever!

Yes. And there is no metal, just a bunch of atoms. And there are no atoms, just temporally
dependent energy fields. And there are no such fields, or time, except in our measurements.

The spoon is taking hold of reality to eat a bowl of cereal. Once the cereal is eaten, instead of
putting down the spoon, it can return to the void from whence it came, so we can act as the next
moment requires.

Any dissonance rests on our side of the equation. The Way puts it to bed -- but is only "the Way"

    ...the way to understanding is a sudden perception that subject and object are one.

I think there's a subtlety here which, when lost, can turn such statements into solipsism.

For example: When looking a tree, there are several aspects involved:

 1. The entity "out there", which I cannot interact with.

 2. The phenonema presented by that entity, such as reflected light.

 3. The receipt of those phenonema by my sensory organs, the eye.

 4. The interpretation of these sensations as brightness, color, form. This is when I start to
    perceive it!

 5. The mental model used to categorize and filter our interpreted sensations. Here I form the idea
    of some "entity" associated with my impressions.

 6. The ideal, of which the mental model is an approximation. This is the noetic "tree", for which
    my impression is an examples. It's a fabrication, but useful.

If the "subject" is the perceiver/interpreter, then the "object" is what begins to appear in #4.
Saying that "subject and object are one" is equivalent to saying that since what I perceive are the
interpretations of my mind, so everything I perceive is, in a sense, just mind. I neither have
access to, nor experience of, anything else.

I believe the error happens when the word "object" is associated with #1.

# Baha'i and Sufi question

r/bahai
jwiegley

The Manifestation for Sufis was Muhammad. You can read a little more here:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sufism#Sufi_beliefs_about_Muhammad

There were many sages during the centuries of Sufi thought, but I don't think even Sufis would
refer to them as prophets. However, they did seek to become manifestations of the Divine
themselves, as a mirror does when fully burnished and oriented toward the sun.

Only when the entirety of self is burned away (faná) does the Divine dwell eternally in the heart
of the believer (baqá). Compare with this Hidden Word:

    O Son of Man! If thou lovest Me, turn away from thyself; and if thou seekest My pleasure,
    regard not thine own; that thou mayest die in Me and I may eternally live in thee.

Sure enough, the end of this Hidden word uses these exact terms, faná and baqá.

In fact, these paired concepts recur somewhat often in Bahá'u'lláh's mystical writings, such as the
Hidden Words (6 times) and the Seven Valleys (4 times), even in places where their appearance is
not obvious from the English translation.

For example, in the Valley of Love he says that the seeker would prefer love's faná to a hundred
thousand baqás, so utterly has he given himself to his loved one. This is significant because baqá
(in God) should not be sought for its own sake; the Beloved must take priority over all else,
including what good may come from His association.

# The Schism: The Northern School of Zen versus the Southern School of Zen.

r/zen
jwiegley

Let's say you have a habit of interfacing with the world through some conceptual framework, and
oddly place yourself as a component within this framework, even though the entirety of it arises
from the same place as your concept of identity.

Next, imagine you're trying to make someone aware (a) of the existence of this framework, (b) of
how it is used to interface with life, and (c) that it is arbitrarily constructed.

Any work you do in the beginning will have to start out within the framework, because there is
nowhere else to start from -- unless the person is uniquely prepared to cast it all aside at once.
And whatever you do within the framework is, in a sense, "throw away work". Really what you're
doing is peeling away and weakening concepts, and loosening the hold these conceptual thoughts have
on consciousness. Meditation, study, etc., can be tools to slow down the hectic bustle of everyday
life, and make some of these things more apparent than they'd otherwise be.

For most people (as in, nearly everyone) this process cannot happen instantly. When they see light
that indicates to them a perception of "tree", they're convinced that what they see is the same
thing as what they understand a tree to be. You end up having to chip away at this false edifice,
weakening it, softening them up, giving them a bitter, red pill to gnaw on until the strangehold
fades.

Yet the moment you're after is an instantaneous one: discarding the framework. It will happen
whenever the person is ready. It doesn't rely on time, or any mental preparation. It can happen in
the twinkling of an eye. The main thing, though, is that it doesn't happen this way. Sometimes a
person isn't ready to jump into the Void, until you've given them nowhere else to go.

So to your question:

    Does enlightenment happen all at once, or does it take time through study and practice

I'd say: Yes.

That said, you can use a final encoding to build up the initial value if needed, or vice-versa, so

# Dating between Baha'is

r/bahai
jwiegley

You’ll find yourself dealing with two very potent issues: the wondrous dimension of new-found
physical attraction, and the challenge of finding someone who will be a good partner for decades to
come. It’s almost impossible to do both of these things, on your own, at the same time. The latter
needs reason, insight, and a level head. The former utterly destroys this.

No one is superhuman, so avoid compromising situations. Talk to friends. Seek the counsel of older
folks who might know you both. Study and serve together, and keep your eyes wide open. Little
things you see today become much bigger as you see them repeated over decades.

And nothing substitutes for a kind and pure heart over time. Learn how they deal with pressure and
hard circumstances. Remember, they want you to see their best side at the beginning, and you’re
just as eager to see it. But you need to know them clearly, to discern if there’s real
compatibility.

# What are the ways one resolves a deep anger?

r/zen
jwiegley

The honesty here is impressive sometimes. Your words remind me of the anger that can follow
divorce; potent, long-lasting stuff.

It won’t help to say, but I believe a key may be found in “All is Mind”. Your anger is at your view
of this person, what you choose to see and focus on, your understanding of the rightness or
wrongness of their actions. Almost certainly they see it differently, or you’d probably be less
angry.

Emotions can dissipate instantly if you see things in a new light. The problem is, such a shift can
almost never be willed. We strive to change the world to change our minds, as inefficient as that
is.

So the anger is a hard reality, staring you in the face. Make it your meditation. Find who is
controlling whom, that has taken charge of your emotions. And this other person doesn’t even have
to participate! You’ve got an effective copy of them in your mind, and the battle is ready any
time.

The farce is sometimes easy to see, but the emotions remain, a fiery, out of control burn. It’s
impressive really. How we see things becomes our experience. Becomes so real that we cease to see
anything else. A gate with no door.

r/zen

Hope you won't hear this as instruction, since that's not my place. I just love your questions and
the spirit in which you ask them; makes it hard not to say what's on my mind.

If you step back from your description, perhaps there's a pattern here. You describe yourself and
the monkey mind -- and Zen -- as if there's an epic battle between "you" the protagonist, monkey
mind the great foe, Zen your sword, and the need for tremendous skill to achieve victory. Maybe
this pattern is the issue, rather than any one of its components.

Speaking for myself, I don't see monkey mind. Not that I don't have what you're describing -- I
think we all do -- but that's not what I look at. Instead, I have manure mind. Nearly everything in
there is bullshit, which no matter how much I try to shape into something beautiful, the odor
eventually reveals the lie.

The answer for me, though, is not to defeat manure mind. How can I make anything clean and pure,
when this is my starting point? Rather, I take note of the fact that if I relax and embrace what
is, then from time to time beautiful things will grow there. They whither and vanish to be sure,
but the less I obstruct this fertility, the more frequently it happens.

I think the quest to achieve perfect mind is an illusion. If instead I see manure mind with the
eyes of a farmer, it's a different kind of perfection.

Yes, this is what I was aiming for. In medieval times the Islamic philosopher Averroes called this

state of faná as the annihilation of "all things", causing a return to (actually, rediscovery, or
Platonic recognition, of) original reality.

jwiegley

Whenever this quandary comes up, I think it’s due to conflating two things: the reality from which
things arise (the One), and those arisen things (the Many).

As a somewhat oblique example, long ago I learned the Arabic alphabet. It took many years, but
finally I could read it without thinking much. The letter that conveys an “n” sound now feels like
that sound, in the way than an English s feels like an s.

But the letter is just a scratch on paper. What is this “n-ness”? How can tiny mark evoke a
feeling, a remnant of sound, a unit of meaning?

The alphabetical identity is the part that arises due to my mind. You could say it lives in me.
Without anyone who knew the language, it would just be lines and dots on a page.

much pre-planning, encounter them as they arise.

jwiegley

    Doesn't realization or a better understanding of mind make control of the self easier, enabling
    more skillful actions within the world, or is this not Zen?

I wonder if this isn't the very opposite of what Zen is about.

When we're young, the whole world is confusing, including ourselves. We resist this onslaught by
seeking to "understand" the nature of things around us: finding names for things, affixing labels,
dividing up the world into neater and neater compartments.

Having formed this bubble of rational endeavor, we expend enormous energy developing its shape as
life progresses. The effort to control and establish who we think we are -- negatively or
positively -- becomes an all-consuming activity. We end up living the story that we tell ourselves,
as life carries on. Constantly mending cracks in the facade, becoming exaggeratedly sensitive to
the flaws and successes noticed by others.

I associate "Zen" with pricking this bubble, and coming to terms with the raw, immediate mystery of
life. It is a return to unknowing, and dealing with things without the presumption of knowing them
intimately. There is a humility and directness in this, a curious wonder; such that mundanity is no
longer the enemy of the future. What is is amazing in that it is. None of us know why, no one can
point to the foundation of reality. All we can do is see it, honor it, and cease to labor against
it or impress our notions of self upon it.

If we apply the habits of Zen to build a keener, more controlled idea of self, all we've done is
convince ourselves that the prison is a resort.

To put it another way: I would hope that Zen leads away from Zen, ultimately. If it's a finger
pointing at the moon, witnessing the moon should, at some point, leave the finger be.

It reminds me of the following from the Tao Teh Ching:

    THE ancient adepts of the Tao were subtle and
    flexible, profound and comprehensive.
    Their minds were too deep to be fathomed.

    Because they are unfathomable,
    One can only describe them vaguely by their appearance.

    Hesitant like one wading a stream in winter;
    Timid like one afraid of his neighbours on all sides;
    Cautious and courteous like a guest;
    Yielding like ice on the point of melting;
    Simple like an uncarved block;
    Hollow like a cave;
    Confused like a muddy pool;
    And yet who else could quietly and gradually evolve
    from the muddy to the clear?
    Who else could slowly but steadily move from the inert
    to the living?

    He who keeps the Tao does not want to be full.
    But precisely because he is never full,
    He can always remain like a hidden sprout,
    And does not rush to early ripening.

The other day I wondered about the idea of a semi-consistent "entity" that accrues around this

come from? What evidence is there for its being? Is it only there because I say it is?

When this thought hit me, it felt like the bed had fallen away underneath, and the whole day was
very different, very strange. I really don't understand how or why emotions work; why some words
bring up anger or pain or exultation; where boredom comes from; why I have the desires that I do.

    What happens when one decides to dive in and fully immerse themselves into Zen?

If Zen serves to prick the bubble that is this "one", what could diving in mean? The very act of
stepping upon the Path enshrines the Path, creating a journey you now must spend so much time
unraveling.

But how else to begin. It's cute to say, "There's nowhere to go, you're already arrived", but this
can't be understood by a mind that wishes to understand.

As if a bubble dove under the sea to find the mystery of water, but was always frustrated by

No sensor, nor sensed. It's the only thing in the room. It is the room as experienced. Delusion
creates the drama that appears to need resolution. It's fascinating that this happens, and how the
emotions are tied to it.

jwiegley

The mind is an eager reality builder. We want to know that the world outside our door is “there”
and how it feels and what it contains and what hopes and fears it will bring. Cue the inner dialog
that constantly shapes the flavor of our life, some wanting to be the hero, others the villain.

If there suddenly was no more world outside my door, would it be different, right now, from not
looking? Schrödinger’s Frogplant.

What’s before us, prior to “placement” is the only real thing we’ll know-not-know. And it’s always
been like this, despite the emotional rollercoaster I force myself to ride.

What I find depressing is when a person thinks this realization is the end. That from here you just
eat and sleep until death takes you. But who wakes up only to stay in bed? That Reality is a
perfect mystery to the mind is only a start! How do we live in mystery (and this is where I think
it gets mystical) and not through definition and dialog?

    And all the time I would go away with a feeling that I'm just pretending.

You can't pretend to be you. Sometimes you're a you who is pretending, but even then you can't
escape what you are.

Reality isn't something you can be or not be. Such possibilities are just images. What you're after
is what you can't escape from: the hand grasping at the idea of a hand.

# Zen practice as pragmatic exercise?

r/zen
jwiegley

Since I sometimes work myself into a state over things that turn out to be untrue (insert
frog-plant here), it should be equally immersive to choose to feel what I'd feel if I were riding a
dragon right now. How is that any less real than the reality I thought was true but wasn't?

In other words: The capacity to self-delude is really something. What's even more remarkable is how
fickle it is. Why should it be tied to what I think is true, causing people to go to great lengths
to trick themselves just to feel the feelings that come from delusion?

Unfortunately it's not translated yet, but there's a prayer from `Abdu'l-Bahá containing a line
that reads (roughly):

    If only you knew how kind was the heart of `Abdu'l-Bahá, cheer and gladness would cause you to
    take flight, and raise such a cry of joy as to reach the very heavens.

    اگر بدانی که قلب عبدالبهاء
    چه قَدر مهربان است
    البتّه از شِدَّتِ فَرَح و سُرور پَرواز نمائی
    و فَريادِ واطوبىٰ به اُوجِ آسمان رِسانی.

This prayer also talks about the kindness of God, with the implication (my reading, of course) that
`Abdu'l-Bahá's kindness is but a glimmer of a reflection.

A book or a class cannot, in themselves, fundamentally change your perspective. That's really more

Asking someone who is better experienced can be helpful, because they'll sense where you're at, and

# Emacs maintainers view of the Remacs (emacs port to Rust)

Question
r/emacs
jwiegley

There's not a whole lot of strategy at the moment, though we welcome people to ask questions in
emacs-devel if they want to get started, and there's a CONTRIBUTORS document we will first point
them to.

    Out of pure curiosity, what ARE the goals of the FSF specifically in regards to the GNU Emacs
    project?

GNU Emacs is a flagship example of "free software" (https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html
), and all its design decisions must take this into account. If a certain technology favors a
closed ecosystem, or a privileged third-party who might wrest control of the platform from users,
it simply can't be considered. Emacs must remain entirely free, and unencumbered; it demonstrates
that a large software project can take this stance and succeed through the efforts of those who
care about these freedoms.

jwiegley

I have no opinion on whether Emacs development should or shouldn't be in Rust. I remember the late
90s when some people wanted everything to be rewritten in Java. Let's see how much excitement there
is in a few years, or if Mozilla stops supporting the language.

What's most important to me is: how many active supppoters would a Rust port attract? What kind of
culture would it create? How inviting would it be to a new generation of developers who want to
continue the tradition that Emacs began (first in TECO, then in C).

If the answer to these questions serve the goals of the FSF better than a C implementation, then
why not?

    Aimlessly working to kindle a fire and gazing at it from all sides.

I think the former is just fantasy. Is reality affected in any way by how you conceive it?

Likewise, while the second may be more “true” — as far as any analogy can be — it doesn’t mean our
mental construction of it is Truth. It has to be directly seen. If you can treat someone else, an
enemy even, as if they were another form of You, this is the beginning. And when it arises from a
fundamental perception, and not forced action or mimickry, then you’re cooking with gas.

I appreciate you sharing your suffering, and asking openly about it. Chronic nausea is so hard; it
saps your will to do most anything else. When nausea overcomes me, I use sleep to pass the time as
quickly as possible. Imagining it might not end is scary.

The Zen view? I wonder what that is. But here's a thought:

You're placing yourself in a context: "here", "now", "nauseated". You're doing this. It locates
"you" in a position that is difficult to escape from, because you're both jailer and jailed.

Your body is averse to the situation, that's a biological fact. Any animal will agree, that shit
needs to stop. How? I don't know; there are medicines. But you also may be magnifying your
perception of it, bending the lens of consciousness so it turns on this moment, this time, this
period of suffering.

I'm sure you have more than this feeling happening. What about the rest of it? Be more than a
single point on a timeline. After all, it could still be so much worse. See what it's not, in
addition to what it is; see the end in the beginning. If all is Mind, there is no line to draw,
only the lines that come and go.

Your question makes me think of this quote from Black Elk Speaks:

    Afterward I learned that it was Pahuska who had led his soldiers into the Black Hills that
    summer to see what he could find. He had no right to go in there, because all that country was
    ours. Also the Wasichus [people of European descent] had made a treaty with Red Cloud (1868)
    that said it would be ours as long as grass should grow and water flow. Later I learned too
    that Pahuska had found there much of the yellow metal that makes the Wasichus crazy; and that
    is what made the bad trouble, just as it did before, when the hundred were rubbed out.

    Our people knew there was yellow metal in little chunks up there; but they did not bother with
    it, because it was not good for anything.

People treat their ideas of happiness as they do gold, not seeing that it also defines sadness,
which comes in even greater measure because of the rarity of happiness.

Zen is the mind that wonders what this yellow metal is that drives people crazy. It’s neither
simple nor complex; it doesn’t say it has no value (since it’s not a question of value) and it
doesn’t say to avoid gold (which presumes it has value to be avoided). It’s the original mind that
sees nothing special, and is surprised at all the to-do. Value is everywhere; value is nowhere.
What’s the difference?

Step 1: Discover a fascinating, ancient text that claims: to awaken to a true perception of your
self, simply “don’t pick and choose”.

Step 2: Pick these books as communicating truth, over all others. In fact, decide that whole
categories of books you’ve never read before must be wrong, such as every religious text.

Step 3: Insist that what others understand is Not The Way. You’ve chosen; defend your choice!

    If it be your wish, O people, to know God and to discover the greatness of His might, look,
    then, upon Me with Mine own eyes, and not with the eyes of any one besides Me. Ye will,
    otherwise, be never capable of recognizing Me, though ye ponder My Cause as long as My Kingdom
    endureth, and meditate upon all created things throughout the eternity of God, the Sovereign
    Lord of all, the Omnipotent, the Ever-Abiding, the All-Wise. Thus have We manifested the truth
    of Our Revelation, that haply the people may be roused from their heedlessness, and be of them
    that understand. — Bahá’u’lláh

# Huángbò Xīyùn: Since Mind is above all activities, so must it be with phenomena.

r/zen

We're definitely clever monkeys. I think we turn to thought because it's tractable: within our
conceptual limits. This conveys a sense of security, predictability, an ability to avert danger and
achieve objectives. And it often works well for these things, though not always.

But relied on too thoroughly, it becomes an apparition all too compelling; like getting so
emotionally wrapped up in a movie, you forget you're just being stimulated by light.

We're waves looking for the ocean. It's not "over there", it's not "beyond", it's not any further
than the eyes we use to seek it. Giving up its form, the wave falls into the Void, but finds that
nothing changes.

jwiegley

I think we create the sense of that beyond by narrowing ourselves to thought, rather than there
actually being a “here” and “there”. It’s like hiding your head under a blanket until removing it
feels like you’ve discovered something wondrous. Yet if you’d never done that, it would just be
“things as they are”. We seek the magical because we’ve confined ourselves to a “mundane” of our
own making. Of course we’re eager to escape! Drama is mind. :)

jwiegley

    In part, Zen is the awareness that the world of form has no real or inherent meaning...

I wonder if it goes even further than this. Your statement above seems to posit "meaning" as an
extra-natural reality, of which forms are deprived, but something Else must necessarily possess.

However, what if meaning is not extricable from forms? For example, I often see on reddit people
posing obvious Examples of Truth, like "1 + 1 = 2". Yet there is no meaning in this statement
beyond mere definitions. Here's how it goes:

If forall x, x = x;
If 0 = 0, 1 = S 0, 2 = S (S 0)), etc;
If forall n, 0 + n = n, and S m + n = S (m + n);
Then:

1 + 1 = 1 + 1        by meaning of =
      = S 0 + S 0    by meaning of 1
      = S (0 + S 0)  by 2nd meaning of +
      = S (S 0)      by 1st meaning of +
      = 2            by meaning of 2.

There is no "meaning" apart from the logic in which these definitions are made. The "truth" of a
statement is identified with every well-defined application of that logic.

So I wonder if the world of forms is the world of meaning, and that meaning, too, is mind. What
we're after is what lies beyond the logic of thought, which can never be described or assessed by
it. To the mind, it is meaningless. It is nothing more than what is.

Analogies, how poor they are.

The reality is that you’re standing on a plain of gold, with a golden shovel, looking out through
eyes and mind of gold. Dig anywhere, and you should find it. But you see dirt, always dirt, and
then this question comes up.

It’s not really that you need to find the right spot to dig, but an experience that jars your
vision sideways. What shape that takes is entirely dependent on you, your background, your mental
state. Hard to invent that ingredient in your own, though not impossible.

So the digging, in this abused analogy, isn’t for the purpose of finding, but a catalyst for
realizing there’s nothing lost. Hone your doubt until the ringing of a stone is enough, and pow, X
marks the ever-present spot.

# What is Zen?

r/zen
jwiegley

I can't answer for you what Zen is, as I'm certainly not qualified. Instead, just a word about
beginnings; something anyone can do, whether they meditate or read or follow a master:

As you look at the world, even what you call "the moment", you're mainly seeing yourself reflected
back at you: your definitions, fears, expectations. There is very little of the world in your
cognition. Becoming aware of this tiny box that encloses your mind, and how even the words you use
-- if you push hard enough -- dissolve away into nonsense: this is where Great Doubt takes hold. It
should lead to moments of dizziness, and insecurity.

This isn't a new thing. Socrates pursued it avidly after the Oracle told him he was the wisest man
alive. From that point on, much of he did was deconstruct people's certainties about "the world".

Books that talk about "living in the moment" aren't showing you the mind-prison, they're gilding
the bars, making the inability to distinguish freedom from imprisonment ever harder, more subtle.
In that way, it's absolutely not helpful. Better would be to look at your anger and impatience as
you sit in traffic, and chase down its source. Do it earnestly enough, and you might enter into a
meditative state by accident, as you listen deeper and deeper to the shape of nonsense that is now.

Prick a soap bubble with a pin, despite all its lovely colors, and what remains? What happened to
the bubble? Where did it go? If your answer to these questions goes from "obvious", to an
intriguing confusion, there will be more to say.

I think using mind as an interface with reality is like a thirsty one seeking to know the Ocean
through a straw. Such a minute part of the experience; all it does is make you more thirsty, and
leave a bad taste in the mouth.

The answer, of course, isn't a bigger or longer straw. Dive in! Instead of tasting, you feel, you
swim, you ken the deeps. Though you still don't know anything, really, does a child need a reason
to play?

Perhaps your "doubling up" is becoming aware of the straw? The mental machinery that processes
experience, so you can confirm you've really had an experience? This is, after all, the source of
"ordinary". Otherwise, whatever's happening right now, I have no name for it. Zen, Void, Mind,

# The one about Delusion and Enlightenment

I love how abstract these things can get. So hard to describe what you're thinking. But we can try,
and fail, and share in the silliness as we do.

Imagine there were a circle, a plain 2-dimensional space. On that circle was a point, moving this
way and that. The point sees itself as a separate entity, and wonders about the vast range of the
circle, and why one side is so different from another. The circle, meanwhile, simply regards the
point as a locus, a momentary focus, knowing that as it ranges about the circle, it sees many
different things; while the circle abides.

In your own life, you dwell at the locus of what could be considered a larger entity. I don't mean
large physically, I mean in the way that raindrops, and the umbrella they fall on, are points
within a larger space we term "rain". It's natural, in each moment, to see them as separate, and
define them independently; but in another sense, there's a common entity that gives them meaning
and one can intuit this reality in addition to the points.

There's one scifi book, Quarantine where I feel this idea was nicely touched upon. In that novel,
he uses quantum incoherence to express the idea of an "unbounded self", with the "locus" being the
state chosen by our will out of many potential eigenstates. Great read.

Anyway, long story short: you hurt when you fall or embarrass yourself because you identify with
the one who fell. Living in the locus. I could quote lots of stuff about Mind here, but if you know
where I'm headed, I don't need to; and if you don't, I'd just fail louder.

them, weakening the certitude of understanding, and breaking the door of the mind prison, until the
mundane becomes transcendental and the transcendental, mundane (since what power do words have to
truly describe?).

Then all there is to deal with is what’s in front of you: not the host of ideas who clamor to
populate that space.

equally unwilling to cut either of them off, even though one is more expendable!

The problem isn’t in the grasping or not grasping. It’s the idea of things. How can you grasp what
you already hold, even though your hand may not be around it? Who can take it away from you, if it
also is who you are? And I don’t mean the physical separation, that is obvious. I mean that the
thing's very thing-ness arises from Mind. See Huangbo’s example of the Void being unchanged by the
cycle of day and night.

You’re not facing an unsolvable problem: you’re accepting the premise that there is a problem at

# Baha'i Mysticism and Mystical Practices

r/bahai
jwiegley

Interesting, I see it as affirming inner truths while correcting errors in outward notions. For
example, a person may say they worship the Sun, and don't need an intermediary to connect with the
Sun. Then Bahá'u'lláh tells them that no one knows the Sun but for the Rays. He doesn't suggest
that the believer's relationship is wrong -- either way, he adores the Sun -- but He corrects a
misunderstanding that has led to countless, misguided philosophical disputes.

Aside from this, both Sufism, and this aspect of the Bahá'í Writings, speak about transcending the
limitations of the logical mind by the transports of love ("teach it the science of the love of
God!"), to the end that one may recognize the True Source, and devote both heart and soul.

# Converts to the Baha'i Faith: What convinced you?

At first I wasn't necessarily convinced, I just wanted to "see it from the inside", which I did for

I was finally convinced by the effect on my life that reading and pondering the Writings
(particularly the Seven Valleys) had on me. Not something I can ever explain, but why do we do
anything? People want to think their decisions are driven by logic and rationality, but how many of
the experiences we cherish most concern the fruits of logic and reason?

# Losing Faith in Baha'u'llah

r/bahai
jwiegley

Quick question: Do you let the words of `Abdu'l-Bahá cause you to question your understanding of
what "abomination of desolation" even means; or do you let your ideas on what it means cause you to
question `Abdu'l-Bahá?

Having read up on this on the Internet, I have no real picture of what the abomination is even
referring to, other than the generality's blindness to the station of the Manifestation of God and
His friends, indicated by the nearly immediate handing over of the reins of Islám to its spiritual
enemies (namely, the Umayyads). This period of time is further connected by `Abdu'l-Bahá with the
prophecies concerning the Beast in the Book of Revelation.

But I don't find it concerning that I don't understand what this prophecy refers to. I'm interested
in learning more, but too often in history people have come to reject the Manifestations because
what They said didn't quite match what people thought They meant. Noah gives a very explicit
example of this, since to outward seeming He was flat wrong in the events that He prophesied. Or
was He? :-)

# Losing faith

r/bahai
jwiegley

Here's a story I haven't told many people before...

When I was a kid, I hated olives. With a passion. It boggled my mind that any human being could
derive pleasure from them, in any way.

Likewise, when I found the Faith, I hated religion. I couldn't say the word "God" without a bad
taste in my mouth. I couldn't pray. It took a full year before I could even read the Writings, it
was just too awkward and bizarre to me.

Time passed, and one day, while reading Herodotus' History, I became so affected by his absolute
raving love of all things olive that I decided to try them again. Peloponnesus green olives.
OMG!!!! They were so amazing!! I would buy them by the pound, and eat the entire pound in one
sitting while reading chapter after chapter of the History. I put olive oil in my hair, on my skin
-- I went olive crazy. Nowadays, olive oil is all I ever put on my salads.

So I asked God: Can you please make prayer be like the olives?

Wanting didn't make it happen. Hoping didn't make it happen. It took decades of thinking and trying
and experimenting. There is no silver bullet unless God wills it; but there is a promise: that
anyone who makes the effort and is patient will find their answer.

    Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to
    you. For everyone who asks receives; he who seeks finds; and to him who knocks, the door will
    be opened.

    Which of you, if his son asks for bread, will give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, will
    give him a snake? So if you who are evil know how to give good gifts to your children, how much
    more will your Father in heaven give good things to those who ask Him!

I wouldn't be discouraged if the path feels remote. If anything, you're learning the true nature of
the path by pushing through the brambles on the side. The key, I think, is to strive for such
patience, that even darkness becomes a lesson about light. Where you are now is the perfect place
to learn about honesty, sincerity, purity of heart, and the attributes of a true seeker. One who
only thinks they've found, and mimicks all the right actions, has yet to taste the sweetness that
follows the bitter cup.

jwiegley

I relate to most of what you've said, as can some of my close Bahá'í friends. I think this is just
real life: ups and downs, times when things are clearer, times when they are more obscure.

Once I couldn't say the obligatory prayer for almost a year. It felt too fake to be praying to God
from a place of obligation. It took 22 years to resolve this within myself, likely due to
upbringing.

It's like a "dark night of the soul", where I seem to be wandering through some wilderness in a
daze. You can't invent faith, or will it to appear. I think the essential honesty of our soul
drives us away from living a sham life for appearances. We only have so much energy before we
return to where we're really at, spiritually.

The only constant in all of this, the unbreakable cord, if you will, was to hold on to my most
favorite selections from Bahá'u'lláh. In fact, my last funk was finally dispelled by savoring the
syllables of this quote:

    O Son of Love! Thou art but one step away from the glorious heights above and from the
    celestial tree of love. Take thou one pace and with the next advance into the immortal realm
    and enter the pavilion of eternity. Give ear then to that which hath been revealed by the pen
    of glory.

Going back to the heart connection with the Source, that is what brought everything else back into
perspective. It's not about the laws, or the religion, or the teaching or not teaching: it is about
nearness to God. Once that goal is firmly fixed, the rest becomes a means to that end, on both a
personal and a global scale. But imperfectly so, since we're growing and learning.

I can't say much more than that. Find Bahá'u'lláh in your heart of hearts, and blind your eyes to
all things else.

# How do you teach the Faith to someone?

r/bahai
jwiegley

Speak to what you love about the Faith. Share your optimism, enthusiasm, how it has affected your
own life. This communicates well, if the person is open, in the sense that we naturally become
interested by anything others show excitement for. And because you're sharing something, not just
relaying information on behalf of a third party.

# This could've been my faith, had I only known.

r/bahai
jwiegley

As a lover of things mystical, I find there is an impossibly wide gulf between our conceptions of
God (which are always wrong) and our experience of God (which is always mysterious). From this
standpoint, even the word "God" does us a disservice, since it lulls one into feeling we understand
what we mean when we say it.

In this respect, atheism is a kind of honesty: rejecting all concepts of the Ocean based merely on
second-hand reports, or one day's playing at the seaside. Even the whales have seen only the
briefest span of it.

So I applaud you for coming to such a point in your religious studies, but would like to suggest
that a new phase exists beyond it: a relationship not based on knowledge or conceptions. Indeed,
faith and death of self are needed here, not rhetoric. "Be nothing then, and walk upon the waves."
Which may seem like madness in our intellectually-driven culture, but what is there to be found is
also, profoundly real.

    The compass of the mind
    is whatever it can conceive;
    but the bound of the heart
    is all that it believes.

To add to what /u/mewesley wrote: I also think that, since spiritual growth is reflected in and

that does harm to ourselves, our environment, or the others we meet along that path.

It's a great question, but I think presupposes its own conundrum.

My guess is that a lot of people imagine the "end of suffering" implies some sort of continual

causes us to reject our present (and only) state.

So it's not that it's preferable not to suffer, but that preference itself is the basis of
suffering. Surely there will always be hardship, but it's up to you whether it's seen as terrible,
challenging, an opportunity, or at the very least better than death.

# Letter of Resignation to LSA - Thoughts?

mit.edu/~jtidw...
r/bahai
jwiegley

No Faith is easy to be a part of in its early days. Look at what happened to the companions of
Noah. It would have been almost impossible for anyone to stay with Noah. Holding to a Manifestation
of God during the time of awakening is always difficult, and historically speaking, most people
just don't. The real numbers always come later, when we have grand churches, large communities with
established support systems, and commonly agreed upon doctrines.

To me, the community of today is an opportunity to serve, not to be served. I can't expect it to be
satisfying, fulfilling, or even easy most of the time. We're scrambling to understand a Revelation
that has never been seen before, and its impact on current social systems is bound to be both
damaging and confusing, as old structures give ways to patterns of thinking outside our present
experience. In a way it's like giving birth: What happens in the operating room is messy, smells
awful, and is full of tension and even screaming. It bears very little resemblance to what your
experience of that mother and child will be even a few weeks later, much less in the years to come.

I think this question concerns the station of Bahá'u'lláh and the nature of His Revelation. All
else is secondary, even irrelevant. If I don't like some of the laws, or if things seems illogical
to me, then this is how I'm experiencing the transformative effect of His Teachings:

    Know verily that the essence of justice and the source thereof are both embodied in the
    ordinances prescribed by Him Who is the Manifestation of the Self of God amongst men, if ye be
    of them that recognize this truth. He doth verily incarnate the highest, the infallible
    standard of justice unto all creation. Were His law to be such as to strike terror into the
    hearts of all that are in heaven and on earth, that law is naught but manifest justice. The
    fears and agitation which the revelation of this law provokes in men's hearts should indeed be
    likened to the cries of the suckling babe weaned from his mother's milk, if ye be of them that
    perceive. Were men to discover the motivating purpose of God's Revelation, they would assuredly
    cast away their fears, and, with hearts filled with gratitude, rejoice with exceeding gladness.

Or my favorite expression of this sentiment, from The Seven Valleys:

        When the qualities of the Ancient of Days stood revealed,
        Then the qualities of earthly things did Moses burn away.

    He who hath attained this station is sanctified from all that pertaineth to the world.
    Wherefore, if those who have come to the sea of His presence are found to possess none of the
    limited things of this perishable world, whether it be outer wealth or personal opinions, it
    mattereth not. For whatever the creatures have is limited by their own limits, and whatever the
    True One hath is sanctified therefrom; this utterance must be deeply pondered that its purport
    may be clear.

# Can you really be content?

r/zen
jwiegley

I've seen some here who stress "contentment and bliss" in Zen, but I have to think it's about being
liberated from "content" vs. "not content". When you have no issue with feeling what you feel, and
nothing needs to change beyond what the moment calls for, then what's the issue? It's not about
constantly riding a happy train; life is what you're in the middle of, right now and always.

# Zen and Illusion

I don't think the Zen guys say the world is an illusion. If you suggested that to them, I have a
feeling you'd get a stick in the face, asking how an illusion just bumped your nose.

What they might say is that the world you think you see is the illusion, and exists as much as your
dreams do: that is, having great effect on your emotions and thoughts, but at the end of the night
nothing has actually changed.

# Zen essence vs Zen periphery

r/zen
jwiegley

    The principal activity of Zen is to penetrate through conceptualization and behold the pure
    mind devoid of all passions, attachments, objects.

This sounds so close to being totally on point and reasonable, but then I step back and find so
much in it that assumes I already know what it means:

Penetrate is given as a verb without defining the action to be taken; it assumes a barrier, an
actor, a place being penetrated to, but defines none of them.

Behold: another great sounding word that seems like the main action, but adds nothing.

The pure mind is...? Calling it pure doesn’t clarify what is meant by saying mind. Or how it can be
devoid; does it otherwise contain things?

Now I’m left with nothing at all, though it still sounds cool. I guess that’s the beauty of
conception for you.

A book is just paper and ink, but I have to go beyond that to reach its meaning; still further to
grasp the intent; and still further to understand its animating principle. This last thing is
wordless, and needed the whole book to bridge the gap between my mind and that of its author.

I feel like some here are saying that Zen is just staring at the paper because that’s what’s
palpably in front of you. Though maybe it’s relating to the principle — which cannot be prisoned
even by intent — and leaving the book behind once its task is achieved.

Great questions. Not yet. :)

Yes, let's chat after I get further into the work. I'm still at the reading stage right now. I was
thinking of doing it the way poly_constraints, with an initial phase of evaluation that produces a
set of typing constraints, and then a second phase of resolution to discover if the set can be
properly reduced.

jwiegley

The full language, enough to replace Nix as an evaluator of nixpkgs. Until the hnix-store project
becomes stable enough, we'll still be shelling out to nix-store and nix-instantiate.

Funny you should ask, since this weekend I'm going to start writing an HN type checker for hnix, so
I've been doing quite a bit of reading.

I found these resources helpful so far:

  • Great for introduction to concepts, but the implementation was hard to follow:
    http://steshaw.org/hm/hindley-milner.pdf

  • A good follow-on read to that paper, clearer algorithm (because of the phase separation):
    https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/8983/233b3dff2c5b94efb31235f62bddc22dc899.pdf

  • This second paper has a reference implementation in Haskell:

I would just need for throwError to rely on a MonadThrow constraint. For the time being, using

I think this assumes a bit too strongly that the normal we had before is the only normal that

# Is the market overvalued? I would like to hear people's opinions for and against this argument. by Nateleb1234
  in stocks

Stocks trade against future earnings... a fair ways into the future. If prices aren't as depressed
as you think, it's because many investors are not expecting COVID-19 to be a major economic factor
by the end of next year. The real open question is how deep in the hole we can get before it takes
5-10 years to climb out (i.e., is this a return of the 1930s?). No one knows, but mainly it's the
virus that's standing in the way of a rebound, which explains why virus news, rather than earnings

# TIL Volatility Will Keep Decreasing Because Robots by gma617

Look up Market Gamma for a counterpoint to this idea. Yes, institutional investors squeeze

the opposite position is taken which actually magnifies volatility pretty significantly. If algo
traders could squeeze all of it out, it would imply they had removed most of the risk from the
market — but movements are not only dictated by internal actions.

# So, what's to stop people from buying a bunch of dividend stocks on margin on the ex date, holding

You generally see shares gap down the next morning by the amount of the dividend. But depending on
the market it may not take very long to return to that price; so maybe not "buy today, sell

However, the longer you wait, the greater the risk, which is why this is not a free-lunch play.

# Covered Calls or Cash Secured Puts? by SparkPlugJalapeno
  in options

If you're ready to hit the buy button, sell an ATM put instead, unless you feel it is urgent to
enter the position. ATM puts are intended to have a 50/50 chance of assignment, which I find
generally works out over time (black swans excepted, of course). So why not collect premium and the
chance of winning that premium outright, if you're in no hurry to actually buy? Then, when you do
get put the shares, use covered calls to sell your way back out, or sell further OTM calls for a
better chance of retaining the position.
I wouldn't sell premium too far out, though. Your capital will be in a sort of limbo until
expiration (if you can't cash out early), and you can't (or shouldn't) sell calls against the
pending assigned shares. This is why I like weeklies for this method, although some like 30-45
days.

# Selling at a loss to repurchase later, does it make sense? by Ra_zord
  in stocks

It didn't sound like you wanted to sell just to book a loss in the tax year, so I'm not sure why
people are warning you about a wash sale. If you buy at $30, sell at $20 and buy back at $10,
you'll still be lowering your cost basis by $10, even if the new cost basis is $20 ($10+($30-$20)).
The main risk is that it doesn't keep going down; but as with any trade, if you're willing to take
the risk and you're right, it can be an effective trade. I thought about selling UA on its way down
when it hit $12. Had I done so, I could have repurchased at $6. But I wasn't sure enough that it
would drop so far.

Yeah, I’d agree, as a separate speculation against surprise downside it makes sense, and gives some

positive and negative delta positions in uncertain times. I just wouldn’t think of it as much of a
hedge, since it won’t recover your capital in the case of another 50% correction. Maybe near half
of it, if the delta on the put moves to something like 0.7.

The difference in delta will mean you’re not getting much protection with that put. Say you buy 100

huge price drop and a massive spike in volatility for that put to recoup your losses on the shares.
At expiration, you’ll not have any protection at all for the first $40 of loss.

# Rolling Covered Calls Forever? by hello_internet1234
  in options

If the stock keeps going up, your call will get deeper ITM and it will have less and less intrinsic
value, meaning when you roll there's not much premium involved.
Imagine a worst case scenario: Your call strike is $10 and the stock is currently $100. Your delta
is probably going to be 0.99. So to buy that call back you'll pay ~$90, but the $11 call for the
next week is going to be pretty close to ~$89, since it's delta may be 0.98. You end up outright
paying for the $1 raise in strike. Meanwhile, the stock could keep going up faster than $1/week,
meaning you'll never catch up and the situation just keeps getting worse.
TL;DR: It's not a linear problem, but a curve that steepens against you as the stock moves the
wrong way.

by the very nature of the beast you lose any structure that doesn't matter (well, except to the

# Selling put options by 89saint

I sell ITM puts if I really want to buy and I'm taking a strong bullish stance. Not too far ITM, so

in the direction you're expecting. If it doesn't, you buy the stock at a smaller discount than
selling an ATM put, but more flexibility. As with anything in options, it's about trade-offs. The
nice thing is that you can fine-tune the position to express your expectations in so many ways.

# How do you read? by SkydivingSexNinja

I actually read fairly little. It's mostly a skimming of headlines from reddit and Google News, and
then diving deeper on anything that really catches my eye. Last week is was the term "gamma

enthusiasm fades, and then move on to the next thing. Over times, these sorts of things start to
connect, which enriches what I had learned previously.

# Emacs native support for multiple regions/cursors by Desmesura  [+1] in emacs

It's really any time I need to edit multiple similar places, or even just multiple lines. Instead
of using rectangle editing these days, I just use mc because it gives me more flexibility.
Example: I insert debugging printfs (poor man's tracing) by inserting print "1.." many times
through a function. Then highlight the region print "1.., select all in the buffer, M-b, M-d and
then C-1 C-m n to renumber them all. I should automate that, given how many times I do it...

# Roll roll roll and the mindset of loses by staarkhand
  in thetagang

There's been one thing that actually helps me when I'm "stuck" in a position: I stop trading it.
That is, if a short put goes against me and I enter an equity position at a loss, I'll leave that
position alone for a long time, maybe sell some calls against it, but otherwise wait for perhaps
months for it to come back.
To an expert trader, this is probably a terrible idea, because I've frozen up capital that could be
making more money than what I'll make when that stock finally turns around.
HOWEVER, I have no guarantee that doing "more trading" would translate into bigger gains. It could
also generate deeper losses. So from a psychological point of view, by taking that money off the
table for a while, it forces me to cool down and be a bit more cautious with the free capital that
I have left.
Sometimes waiting is a good strategy, if more activity would create bigger losses; but I agree that
sometimes it's also a terrible one, if there are other, better opportunities available. For me, I
use it as a mechanism to force risk aversion on myself when my DD hasn't been panning out.

There would be a change at each deviation of IV, with Vomma giving you the rate of that change, and
Ultima the rate of change of Vomma. But rather than calculate the new delta yourself, you could use
a platform like ThinkOrSwim (or I imagine other tools will do this) to adjust IV in the risk
analysis tab down by 30% and then it will calculate the new delta for you based on the chosen
model.

# Question about option selling/writing by delosx1

I'm not sure exactly what you mean by "buy back the premium", but basically: The moment you sell

contract to close, in which case you're paying premium to another party -- likely using some of the
money you gained from selling the option in the first place.

# Strangles, the best way to play earnings? by potatofan1738
  in options

Two other things to think about: if you blow through one side, rolling the winning side only gives
you as much as the premium sold there to absorb the shock. But the increase in loss can accelerate
much faster, if the underlying moves by, say, 20-30%.
Second, IV crush isn’t a guaranteed shock absorber. Earnings season takes place while other things
are also happening in the world, and those events can sometimes effect volatility more than the
earnings event.
In effect, you’re selling insurance to two people, and betting that the event will never be so bad
as to exceed the premium on both.

My favorite quote in this regard:
    O My servants! Sorrow not if, in these days and on this earthly plane, things contrary to your

    are assuredly in store for you. Worlds, holy and spiritually glorious, will be unveiled to your
    eyes. You are destined by Him, in this world and hereafter, to partake of their benefits, to
    share in their joys, and to obtain a portion of their sustaining grace. To each and every one
    of them you will, no doubt, attain.
Also consider that anger of this sort often arises from expectations: things we expected of life,
and of God, such that not being given them causes us anger and frustration — especially when those
who complain and take their lives for granted are seemingly given everything. It pays to dig deeper
into the root of such feelings, instead of stopping at the level of blame. If God is truly all
loving, there is more to this story.

Effectively, getting assigned after market when you can’t exercise or sell, putting you at risk of
a price shift within that window.

# Learned the downside of covered calls this week.. by doctrader
  in options

You can roll forward and up, if you think it will drop again. Or you can buy back and sell a put,
if you don’t mind the risk of increasing your equity. That way you get to keep profit on the shares
today, by transferring that loss into the short put. I’ve done this three times in the past week,
when my outlook switched from bearish to bullish on a covered call.

# Sold a tsla 980 C 5/01... help me please by pingnpong

That’s definitely the safer route, and could protect you from some pin risk. Let your broker know
that if assigned, you want them to exercise the long to cover.

# Help fix option spread trade gone wrong by senorpickle3

I would suggest going flat the day of expiration, assumed you aren’t assigned first. If that
happens, and you can’t afford to buy the shares at market price, your broker would likely exercise
the long call and you’d be out the strike width. If you don’t even have that much capital, I’m
surprised you haven’t already received a phone call and a warning of liquidation.

# When you were assigned early, how many DTE were left? by 3X-Leveraged

The former was exercised within a week of WORK's all-time low, so if they didn't want the shares
anymore that one makes sense. They could have cashed out the contract to conserve premium, but then
they'd be stuck with depressed shares. The latter was most likely a liquidation.

# Help fix option spread trade gone wrong by senorpickle3
  in options

Buying a call below would just stop you from further loss, but you'll have to pay the premium in
addition to what you'd lose by just closing now. Another way to do it is to buy enough shares to
get delta neutral, if you think it might drop enough to gain back by selling. This doesn't get rid
of the loss, though, it just stops the bleeding. And it requires fairly active management, and
capital for the shares.
Aside from this, I'd recommend closing, or buying a higher strike call to define the loss. But be
ready to take that loss in full.

# Question about spreads and assignment by innocent-podestrian
  in options

If you don't have the funds to purchase the shares on assignment, your broker (but really you
should ask them this question) ought to liquidate your covering put for you.
With TD, for example, you'd need option level 3 -- and thus, a margin account -- to trade such
credit spreads.
This should also indicate that if you're asking a question like this here, don't start with credit
spreads. Building intuition for how IV and time affect your position is a bit harder when you're
both long and short. Best to start with straight plays: cash-secured puts or long calls, to get a
feel for how they behave in various scenarios. When the mechanics of credit spreads start to make
complete sense, that's the time to start trading them.

From

    Barclays 20+ Year Treasury Bond Fund (NYSE:TLT): Just like long bonds suffer when inflation
    kicks in due to a decrease in buying power, by locking in a current rate now with a future
    deflationary environment brewing, long bonds with yield are where you’ll want to be. While say,
    a 3.5% yield may not seem like much when you’re used to the context of 2-3% inflation, if
    you’re in a -3% deflationary environment, that’s a risk-free “real” 6.5% yield per year which
    is unheard of. Expect long duration Treasuries to rally and see yields drop if deflation kicks
    in. Short term bonds don’t have as much room to run as the yields are already at historic lows
    and the curve has some tilt to it. As the yield curve flattens out in expectation of a
    deflationary environment, those longer duration yields drop, driving the bond prices higher.

When I feel everything is going against me, it probably means my emotions are getting clouded, and

At such times it's best to withdraw and take a month off. For your individual trades above, you'll
have to go with your gut and your own research, but once you're out, avoid opening new positions
until your head is back on straight.
The same is true on the flip side if I should start getting too cocksure or thinking I've "figured

Winning should confirm what you understand, and losses should inform future decisions. Much beyond
that, and you may be in for more surprises.

# Managing covered calls. Converting to inverted strangle by makotohadou2
  in thetagang

I had a covered call this week that I was rolling up and out, but it just became too much in the
money. So I bought the call back and sold a put at the same cost. In a sense, I'm shifting the loss
from the short call into the cost basis of the shares-to-be-assigned on the put. It's a transition
from bearish to bullish, as now my loss is diminished by further moves upward, rather than
increased. But at expiry I'd rather have more shares with a higher cost basis, than take the loss
directly with the call.
Of course, it's only in my mind that these two things are connected. After buying back the call, I
could have sought other ways to recover the loss.

# Is this a valid approach?? by NeverNotDope
  in options

It's useful to track your gains and losses.
Here's another thing you can do:
 1. At the start of each month or year, note the total dollar value of your cash account. Consider
    these as "shares" with a value of $1.00 each.
 2. Each time you book a gain or loss, multiply the number of your "shares" by their current price
    (starting at $1.00), add the gain or subtract the loss, and divide by the number of shares.
    This reprices your "shares". For example, if you had 10,000 @ $1.00 and booked a gain of
    $1,000, then you'd have 10,000 @ $1.10.
 3. Each time you add or withdraw money to/from the account, divide it by the current value of your
    shares and add/subtract that amount to/from the shares. So if you withdrew $1,000 in the
    example above, you'd reduce the number of shares by 909.09 ($1,000 / $1.10).
With these records, the "dollar value" of your shares minus $1.00 will equal your ROI over the time
period that you do the tracking. In the example above, 10%. Subtract from this your index of choice
to determine your alpha, or how much you've out or under-performed the market.
This can be of course be automated using a spreadsheet, as long as you enter your gains and loss,
and deposits and withdrawals. I've gone ahead and created such a spreadsheet for you here:
http://ftp.newartisans.com/pub/ROI.xlsx
Just one number per line into gain, loss, deposit or withdrawal, and it will keep a running tally
of your ROI. You could use sub-totals to track the same numbers you mentioned above as well.

The original seller might have the shares. Or maybe they transferred their risk by purchase of an
identical contract to someone else willing to write it; and if THAT person doesn’t have the shares,
they may have to pay to buy the shares at market price on the day of expiration, no matter how
high. Theoretically unlimited.
Always have the shares if selling a call, or buy a higher strike call as insurance to form a
spread. Selling naked calls is like shorting stock with less profit potential.

If they did, the assignment would affect the person who sold the contract to you — unless they in
turn had transferred their obligation to someone else as well.
Think of a contract as between two parties. At any time either of the parties can trade places with
someone else, but every moment in time there is still a contract and always two parties bound by
it. The person who first creates the contract “writes” it, and it lives until either expiration,
exercise, or until you become the holder of both sides.

Do note that this market is very up and down. In your position I would sell a near ATM call and

Today I sold $52 SHAK APR 24 calls against my shares when SHAK was trading at $50.5. It took about
two hours to reach 50% profit as SHAK dropped to 49. This is how intraday volatility creates short

# Plug the holes in my strategy! by Skwigle

For #6 you have to be willing to take a loss sometimes. I sell calls against sunk positions, make

week. Doing that with three positions right now. When they turn back around, I close. You just have
to know your risk limits and stick to your strategy as if you were born from logic.
Example: I have shares of CRWD at basis $78. Sold a call with strike $47.5 back when it was low
40s. It’s now near 70. Now begins the long game of rolling that call up until I’m ready to take the
loss. Not near there yet in this market, though, when earnings next month could easily send it low
again.

Best is for the profit to exceed the loss. But if it’s really 90%, then 10:1 can work out, but the

One reason that shares are good for delta hedging is that they have a fixed delta that doesn't

account the gamma on your hedge as well as the delta you accomplish at the time of sale/purchase.

It’s my favorite strategy in fact. Just beware that when a black swan hits — and this happened to
me in March — you’ll end up getting assigned on every one of your puts, buying stock for 50% or
more than what it’s currently trading at. It’s no fun being obligated to buy BA for $300 when it
trades at $90.
So you just have to plan for this. Now I have equity that I keep selling calls against, and intend
to hold on to for a long time. That’s why it’s essential to pick companies you’re ready to buy and
hold. Options are a way of directly trading the unpredictability of the market, so every once in a
while it’s going to strike you like a viper.

A covenant breaker can only be named as such by the Universal House of Justice, and only if the
individual has demonstrated a pattern of actively seeking to undermine the authority of the House,
Shoghi Effendi, or ‘Abdu’l-Bahá (i.e., the line of succession from Bahá’u’lláh). Doing so could
lead to deep schisms in the community, and so we do not tolerate such behavior, choosing instead to
entirely dissociate with such individuals. There are covenant breakers active today on the Web, but
Bahá’ís do not (or should not) interact with them.
The argument used against this position is that we are denying a full investigation of the truth,
or maybe they have some basis for their claims, etc. But it is the position of Bahá’í law that
unity is paramount, to the extent that if any two should argue about religious truth, both are
wrong simply by that fact.

# Stocks vs Leaps on calls by beats_working_

A LEAP gives you plenty of time and good leverage, but the trade-off is low delta unless you're
deep ITM. And it pays no dividends, though it does reduce total risk.
But you can easily control 10x the shares using a LEAP for the same or less capital, to offset the
delta, as long as you don't make a terrible mistake in timing.
I use LEAPs myself maybe 10% of the time, but generally prefer equity so that I can sell calls and
not worry about theta.

If holding to expiration, you need the stock to move beyond your strike, in the amount of the
premium paid, to reach break even (no loss, no profit). Anything beyond that is where your profits
come from.
If closing prior to expiration, a few factors could bring you a profit, such as a surge in IV, even
if your stock is above the strike by a bit.

If you stay on top of the position, you should be OK. Likely your best chance for profit will be
closing early, first the short and then the long. Volatility should help with that, since we
haven't held consistent in any one direction lately.
Meanwhile, why not buy a put with the same delta? You'd be paying up front, though depending on
similar (market goes down) yet simpler (you only want down) market conditions, with a bigger profit
potential. Are you using the credit spread because you want the payout in advance?

# Question about taxes by [deleted] in options

If you have losses, they should offset your gains.
How much you end up paying in taxes, even knowing the amount of your gains, depends on so many
factors related to your financial situation that we can't possible answer that question here. Your
best option is to seek advice from someone knowledgable in the field, who can review your income
and expenses. If you made $10k in options, spend $500 of it on a tax accountant.

# Vertical Put Spreads by heinzmoleman
  in options

A put debit spread (bearish) caps gains to reduce the cost of buying the put outright. A put credit
spread (bullish) limits risk by giving up some of the premium. See
https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/032614/which-vertical-option-spread-should-you-use.asp

Where premium is the cost of the long minus the sale of the short.
Also note that a put credit spread is very similar, risk/reward wise, to a call debit spread (and
other equivalent positions in this matrix). See some notes on differences here:

closing at target profits today. It’s a wild ride, which means the most essential thing is to keep

Why is that a steal? ThinkOrSwim tells me the market predicts a +/- move of 9.3 points by that date

That’s a maximize possible profit of $5,500 (.55 * 100 * 100) by putting $260,000 at risk. Sure you
could sell the SPY shares at a profit sometime later, but you don’t know how long you’d end up

The Fed’s job is to manipulate the economy toward a consistent 2% inflation rate, and its actions

I think your question is whether there are people who are engineering these changes for their own
personal gain while others lose. Because it’s fully intended to manipulate things for the benefit
of the US overall.
When China did the same thing recently, the President openly accused them in the press of being
currency manipulators. Here the problem isn’t that they’re affecting interest rates — which all
central banks do all the time — but that it was feared they were doing it in a manner worthy of a
mitigating response.

My current goal is around 1% realized income per month. I assess trades in terms of maximum risk

worst case is unfavorably entering an equity position that I believe has strong future potential.
So, selling premium against Bank of America is much preferred over buying SPY puts.

# TLT and other bonds by inhumanforms in options

Think of a bond’s interest rate as an incentive. It goes up when the bond is cheap to entice people
to buy; it goes down when the bond is pricey because the incentive isn’t needed as much.
Treasury bonds are the savings account of the market: it’s where you park loads of cash because
they’re secured by the US government. In times of crisis or risk aversion, generally bonds (and
TLT) will go up, because demand is high from all the money moving into them.
However, recent dilution of the dollar has caused cash equivalent assets (like bonds) to become a
bit less attractive, because although such money is safe, it’s deteriorating in value. So things
fluctuate between the need for safety and the need for return.

# Selling options? by slampig3 in options

I’ve been selling options regularly (5-30 trades a week) for nine months now. On PUTs I’ve lost
money only once, because I made a hugely wrong bet during an earnings week. I consider it a
valuable education well paid for. I do get assigned shares ~30% of the time, and sell later at a
profit. The real question is how long you have to wait, and whether the money could have done
better elsewhere. Pure profit is not the only measure.
I also sell a lot of covered calls, and sure, I lose out on upside from time to time. It makes for
a nice income generator over an equity position that isn’t doing much otherwise.
I have monthly goals that I benchmark my trading against. I’m not looking for large profits when
selling premium, but consistency (and relative safety) of income. Doing it frequently over solid,
value-based underlyings is the key. Stick to around .3 to .2 delta on the sell side. Use limit sell
orders and be patient.

If you are holding a contract, you don’t need anything else to sell it.

return if delta is not very high (that is, the loss of time value is offset by the higher delta of
shares being sold).

I recommend the CBOE Online Options Course (http://www.cboe.com/education/education-main). Not only

Delta increases as strike moves further ITM while Gamma decreases away from ATM. Vega increases
with more days to expiration while Theta decreases with more DTE.
Your example might be clearer if you just played with one variable at a time, rather than looking

Volatility isn’t movement, it’s expected moves. Although SPX took a dive, central banks have taken
significant action to restore stability, which I think started getting priced into expectations, if
not share prices themselves, on Friday.

# I'm still learning about option investing and have a question about IV "crush". by 731Lee  in
options

Volatility dropped Friday, and your contracts were almost all premium. IV could well be different
next week, but it’s hard to expect a VIX >80 again. The reality of the situation is settling in and
pessimism is getting priced in as the shock of surprise deadens. You can only crash like ‘80s so
many times and catch people that unawares.
But who knows, some are predicting a possible drop down to $160 range if supports are further
blown. And long-term economic impact is not yet fully understood.

# For those of us holding through and not selling at a los by Thump604
  in options

Covered calls + rolling. Since you’re likely to have to wait a year or more for the market to turn
around, there’s no hurry, and you can afford to wait out any upswings.
Downside is if you cover just when volatility drops and your stock begins a steady upward climb
that lasts for months on end. This strategy needs some corrections to give you a release valve.
Know the patterns of your market segment.

# Covered calls: Deep in the money by samdaryoung
  in options

The deeper you go, the less premium you get over and above the price difference, until you’re
basically just booking the sale early while tying up capital to do so.
I prefer to sell close to the money, thinking similar thoughts. You want to maximize the effect of
theta to offset the price move.
Note: the reason this works out over time is because the market tends to over-predict downward
moves (by about 5% according to Option Alpha’s analysis). But you have to do it often for it to be
a net winning strategy.

You don’t have to, but it certainly can’t hurt! One nice thing about options is that it rewards the
educated over time, since it’s a many-pronged instrument. For stocks you have fundamental and
technical analysis, which you can read about in the newspaper and on TV; the general public knows

# Can we talk about IV over 100% ? by stilloriginal
  in options

    Implied volatility is expressed as a percentage of the stock price, indicating a one standard
    deviation move over the course of a year.
Thus, an IV of 250% implies a 68% chance of a 2.5x move in price within the year. If the curve over
that year were flat — though there is no reason to assume that — then 1.25x in six months.

# Buying options on /ES instead of SPY by short-gamma
  in options

The premiums are high because every point of /ES is worth $50. It’s good to trade if you want that
multiple. Also, you’re not trading an index but expectations on an expectation, so movements could
get a bit strange sometimes. Finally, the fees are higher, and liquidity can be very different
depending on which end month your option is against.
It pays to research the ins and outs of how futures options can differ.

# Buying calls 6 months out? by immrmeseek
  in options

It doesn’t just have to go up in six months. For you to profit well, it has to go up higher than
the rest of the market is also expecting. OR, it needs to go up suddenly, sharper than expected,
and you sell the contract on the bump.

# Options Trading by [deleted] in thinkorswim

If you trade a lot, you can ask to reduce fees to $0.50. Beware that index options have a fixed fee
of $0.65 on the exchange side, and if your TD fee becomes less than that, you’ll have to pay both.
For example, when trading VIX options.

# Options - buying or selling? by G_E_N_I_U_S in options

But it’s very much a theoretical infinite. On the short put side, you end up with expensive stock.
On the short call side, you have to buy and then sell at a loss. The odds of a stock going to zero
or infinity (the max loss scenarios) in after-market the day before assignment — how many times has
that happened?

# Is there a place i can find option price charts by [deleted] in options

In the TOS app go to charts, and enter the option symbol. This will give you a price chart for the

name. It will begin with a period and contain several letters and numbers.
Note too that if you do this in the Active Trader, you can buy/sell contracts with single clicks,

# Deep ITM Put? by bobbythebich in options

The same with PUTs, but not any more or less 1:1. This is exactly what the delta represents, this
ratio.
However, there is also gamma, by which the delta of your long put position improves as the
underlying drops further, or if time passes and the stock remains flat or drops. It will never be
truly 1:1, however, only asymptotically close as the stock drops to $0 or when expiration arrives.

# Deep ITM Put? by bobbythebich in options

Right, the deeper in the money you go, the less time value you’re paying for, as you begin
approximating an equity stake in the position (delta of 1 or -1). At that point, you’re buying
leverage and risk limits in exchange for the possibility of a total loss of premium.
For example, I use deep in the money LEAP calls sometimes when I feel sure about a stock, but want
to use the leverage to keep some capital free for other plays.

# GLD 2022 leaps are up 70% this week while GLD is flat by hangingbacon in options

IV is implied volatility. It defines what volatility would have to be to justify what people are
willing to pay for options today.
A surge in future GLD contracts means that many people, or one person buying many contracts, have
reason to believe gold will alter course in the future. The recent backwardation in the gold
futures market is another indicator this may happen.
So, IV doesn’t drive prices, rather it’s a reading of the market’s actual activity. Which, of
course, affects prices when it changes what people do who pay attention to IV. :)

Btw, the bid isn’t what you have to sell your contract for, that’s just what someone is willing to

# Realistic to swing trade options? by agrenet in options

I like to swing trade on the short side, selling calls and puts and often closing the same day due
to these intraday swings. When IV drops again it should help any open positions; I roll weeklies
forward and up/down when things turn against me, because it doesn’t take long lately for things to
turn back.
It’s a very different market from two months ago. Premiums are intense, meaning it only takes a 20%
return on a trade to net the same as a 75% return before (i.e., aiming to keep that much of the
premium before closing).

# Is it true that majority of options traders lose more money than they make over time? by LiL_penut
in options

If instead of buying stocks outright you sell puts at the strike you intended to buy at anyway,
then it’s not possible to lose any more than you would on the stock itself.
Options aren’t the problem. They just empower some people to misuse leverage, such as those who buy
huge numbers of far out of the money contracts in hopes of a 20:1 pay out.
Used well, they are a nice (and interesting) income generator on top of equity and cash portfolios.
If you can tolerate more risk, they are also an effective tool in the right hands. They can be many
things, actually; it depends more on the investor than the instrument.

# What are your methods of staying more mindful throughout the day? by kerdich in zen

I think when most people talk about becoming mindful, the real issue is that they see their current

mindful; find why you think that you are not.
For example, if you spend the whole day daydreaming and barely notice what's happening around you:
what are you dreaming about and why does it captivate you? That's where your energy is going, so it
doesn't make too much sense to attempt to negate it by elevating the importance of what interests

# Huangbo, Bankei and Layman P'ang: There can be no death for what was never born, so if it is
unborn, it is obviously undying. There's no need to say it, is there? by [deleted] in zen

    There seems to be a problem inherent in the very limitations of perception: perceiving through
    the senses and being bound to thoughts tends to allow the mistakes of making great sweeping
    distinctions, as in this is mine and that is yours.
I would say the "problem" is that we learn early on how thoughts can influence feeling, and that
some feelings are preferable to others. So we begin to use thought to engender feeling, and feeling
to corroborate thought.
A friend the other day told me about a worry she had at work. I mentioned that the future is an
unknowably large cloud of possibilities, and although we can associate probabilities to some of
those events, we are far more often wrong than right. Why do we choose the event we fear and
"pre-live" it, in a sense, magnifying that fear until it terrorizes us? It's almost as though we
fear it so much, we'd rather get the bad feelings out of the way, so when it really happens it's
just an event and not a shock.
But this is like thinking about the coldness of a lake before jumping in. This makes it so much
harder to take that first step. Better is to think about it afterward, and let the shock roll
through you.
If thought could not manipulate emotion, or if emotion did not influence thought, we might stop
trying to observe what could happen, or gaze at the past reflecting on everything that did not
happen.

# [Help] Trading Futures in the Long Term by dosel112132131

From https://www.thebalance.com/guide-to-futures-market-expiration-dates-1031175:
    ... the true purpose of a commodity futures contract is to exchange goods for cash at some
    future date. The expiration date represents the day when that cash-for-physical-goods
    transaction takes place. That is why futures have an expiration date, as farmers and commercial
    goods producers use the futures market to buy or sell goods at pre-determined contract prices
    at a future date.
I suppose there aren't futures contracts with multi-year expirations because there isn't much of a
market for them. Instead, you would roll from contract to contract as each nears expiration, the
way the ETFs do that track futures.

I like selling PUTs, less buying either, unless it’s part of a more complex position.

# Is this a valid way to use the greeks? by NeverNotDope
  in options

    Still trying to understand how some people are super fearless and seemingly almost always
    profitable when it comes to options.
Are you on sites where people only post their winnings?
When I buy options I have to be right about both the direction and the timing. It makes me much
more uneasy than trading stocks, although the capital involved is usually much less.
When I do decide to buy a stock, sometimes I think, “you know, I’m willing to be patient and buy
that at a lower price. I’d like to pay X.” So instead of buying with a limit I sell PUTs. Now I’m
fearless, because the worse thing that could happen is that I guess wrong and miss out on a surge.
But since I do this for many positions, I’m never wrong about all of them. It’s in this respect
that I can be fearless, and entirely unworried about my open trades.
Otherwise, the biggest question that never goes away is: could the money have been better risked
elsewhere and by other means?

# [HELP] Bitcoin Futures Trading by dosel112132131

I don’t believe so. To apply for futures trading you must have a margin account (at TD), and there
is no way to disable it. What you are asking for is crypto trading, no? Something I think TD is
soon going to offer.
Because part of the merit in trading futures is the high leverage, parity of long and short
positions, liquidity, and ameliorating counter-party risk through margin requirements and daily
marking-to-market.

Nowadays with cheap transaction fees, for 10 contracts I think it’s a $5 difference maybe? The real
question is what you think will happen to the underlying in the after-market on the last day. Sell
the contract and lock in your gains (assuming enough liquidity to find a buyer, of course), or let
the chips fall where they may.

# Huangbo Xiyun: The arising and the elimination of illusion are both illusory. Illusion is not
something rooted in Reality; it exists because of your dualistic thinking. by [deleted] in zen

Good question, since I think it's neither active nor passive (perhaps a false dichotomy in this
case), so let me give a mundane example to illustrate:
For years of my life I pushed myself to meet certain goals, established by society, that had so
worked themselves down into my tissues that I didn't recognize them as self-established (i.e., even
if society authored them, I'm the one who accepted them and gave them power).
In a sense, society told me to tie a carrot onto a long stick, and then tie that stick to my back
so the carrot would dangle about a foot in front of me. Then it said, "Run, catch the carrot! All
good people can catch the carrot!" And off I went, happy when I felt like I was gaining ground, and
sad when I realized I hadn't.
One effect of studying Zen is that I observe my friends and family doing something similar:
stretching themselves on a rack of their own making -- while almost nothing I say makes any
emotional difference to what they're experiencing. It took me years to see both that the stick was
there, and that I was the one who had put it there and invested it with value, creating the whole
game.
So I ask you: Is seeing the existence of the stick and its emotional dynamic a passive endeavor, or
an active one? It may take years of observation and discernment to notice what's happening, but
only seconds to dismantle; or it could take a few seconds in a near death experience and years to
process. Or it could happen just by sitting quietly until the absurdity of the rat race dawns on
you. Who knows what leads to the discovery, and how it's processed, but I can vouch for the fact
that it's easier said than realized.
This is only a mundane example, but mental concepts do this to our experience of reality also: They
setup a framework that promises to convey understanding, meaning and value, but instead only reduce
awareness down to a plastic construct that is self-defined, such that to a large extent we seeing
just what we've decided we're seeing.

# Huangbo Xiyun: The arising and the elimination of illusion are both illusory. Illusion is not
something rooted in Reality; it exists because of your dualistic thinking. by [deleted] in zen

Conceptions draw a veil over reality: "enlightened", "ordinary". Cease to indulge in concepts and
these disappear, so long as you're not also separating "ceasing to indulge" and "indulging" as
concepts. But does this mean there's no difference between a person who is veiled by concepts and
one who is not? Do the sun and moon illumine equally?

# Huangbo Xiyun: The arising and the elimination of illusion are both illusory. Illusion is not
something rooted in Reality; it exists because of your dualistic thinking. by [deleted] in zen

Erasing differences again? :) Get that shit sandwich ready!
    If the arising and the elimination of dreams is itself an activity of dreaming, then where
    exactly is the problem? And if the dream only exists because of sleeping, could there really be
    any difference between being awake and not awake?
In your version, do you mean to conflate the elimination of illusion with enlightenment? Is the
negation of a non-existent the same thing as seeing?

# Something from the Mumonkan by TaoistAlchemist
  in zen

This version of the case gives a bit more context:
    When Master Guishan was under Baizhang, he had the position of tenzo [cook]. Baizhang wanted to
    choose a master for Great Gui Mountain in the province of Konan. He called the head monk and
    the rest of his disciples together to have them present their views and said that the
    outstanding person should be sent. Then he took a water jug, put it on the floor, and said,
    “You may not call this a water jug. What will you call it?” The head monk said, “It cannot be
    called a wooden sandal.” Baizhang then asked Guishan. Guishan immediately kicked over the water
    jug and left. Baizhang laughed and said, “First monk, you have been defeated by Guishan.” So he
    ordered Guishan to found the new monastery.
The head monk answered in the realm of words, which Baizhang warned against. Guishan demonstrated
its function in that moment, and that it stops being a water jug when there is no water in it.

# base: Category polymorphic Functor and FunctorOf by Iceland_jack

Before I'd be convinced, I'd want to see that there are enough non-`(->)` Functors in common use

it feels like building in a capability that forces the community to pay migration costs, but offers

# Master Hui Hai: Zen Gangster. (Huangbo's daddy and Linji's pappy.) by [deleted] in zen

I'm sympathetic to your point, while averse to suggesting that without quoting Zen masters, you
can't arrive at the place Zen is aiming for. Since, after all, none of the Zen masters advocated
quoting Zen masters, it was never a "part of the teaching" in antiquity.
But indeed, this is the Internet, and without some sort of grounding you end up with people
claiming that petting a bunny rabbit is the same thing as enlightenment.
So, point taken /u/theksepyro  . It makes the job of keeping the forum at least within some order
of proximity to Zen all the more difficult if we don't remind ourselves what "commonly agreed to
Zen" has to say on these subjects.

# Master Hui Hai: Zen Gangster. (Huangbo's daddy and Linji's pappy.) by [deleted] in zen

If the forum is about Zen, the living thing, the quote above makes the argument for me.
If the forum is about observing Zen, the historical artifact (excluding even modern developments
like Soto), then your statement makes sense and I would agree.
Since neither of these is a complete picture of what the forum is, no insistence should be made on
either.

# Phony AMAs? Also, AMA!!! by ThatKir
  in zen

Yes, Huangbo's statement is quite popular around these parts, though he appears to indicate that
one must be so complete in their compassion (24/7, as you say) that they do not divide beings into
"saved" and "not saved", as that would lead back to dualism. Later in that quote he says:
    and, as to mercy and compassion, if for your sakes I take to thinking things out and studying
    other people’s concepts—in neither case will you have reached a true perception of the real
    nature of your own Mind from within yourselves. So, in the end, these things will be of no help
    at all.
You don't help a sinking man by throwing him a book on swimming; you must jump in as well.
But I'm interested in your use of the plural. Do you know of quotes from other Zen Masters who have
said this? Dogen certainly does not; nor has the Internet yielded anything obvious. I'd appreciate
learning more.

Isn’t this just the One vs. Many conundrum all over again? It’s not the case that maleficent people
are really “the most compassionate of all” because you want to reconfigure yourself not to be

choose, but this doesn’t mean getting trapped whenever you stand in front of two doors.
So I respectfully reject the premise of this post. His influence degrades the quality of this

# What's your evidence that Zen isn't nihilist? by AbjectEntrance

Nihilism is defined as “extreme skepticism maintaining that nothing in the world has a real
existence.” I think Zen appears to coincide when we talk about the role of mental conceptions, but
nihilism would stop short of statements like this from Huangpo:
    That which is called the Place of Precious Things is the real Mind, the original
    Buddha-Essence, the treasure of our own real Nature. These jewels cannot be measured or
    accumulated. Yet since there are neither Buddha nor sentient beings, neither subject nor
    object, where can there be a City of Precious Things? If you ask, ‘Well, so much for the City
    of Illusion, but where is the Place of Precious Things?’, it is a place to which no directions
    can be given. For, if it could be pointed out, it would be a place existing in space; hence, it
    could not be the real Place of Precious Things. All we can say is that it is close by. It
    cannot be exactly described, but when you have a tacit understanding of its substance, it is
    there.
To a nihilist, I don’t see them agreeing with anything being “there” at all, concerning both
Cities.

# merry no-christmas by howslifeinlondon
  in zen

You’ve come to a place that is prone to argue only one side of this question, so I’ll play the
paradoxical devil’s advocate:
Belief answers a question, but faith is demonstrated by living it: through interaction with the
world and your community. Going to church isn’t only a restatement, any more than you’d stop seeing
a girlfriend just because you’ve already said you love her.
Lots of people here meditate and spend years of their life studying koans because they heard about
enlightenment or the Void or the Unborn and they want to strip away delusions and see it for
themselves. The fact that they expend this time and energy for the sake of something they’ve
neither seen nor experienced: this is faith. Otherwise, why waste a year of effort with no return?
Faith is acting on behalf of an Unknown, that you cannot know yet feel connected to.
Christ as found in the Gospels is quite different than what you see in churches, so I don’t blame
you if it feels stale and out of place there. If you study the lives of early Christian mystics, I
think you’d find a lot more in common with Zen than even most here would be willing to accept.
But it’s your existence and it’s worth exploring. Neither church nor r/zen are the places for
answers, but we’re happy to burrow into any set-doubt that could lead to a moment’s realization.
You might even find that Zen can make church an interesting subject of observation. Just watch out
for the feeling that you’ve achieved an elevated viewpoint above most others — which can lead to
many of the other behaviors you’ll find here too. Yet none of us know, because the mind isn’t the
tool of progress. We’re simply advocates of the ordinary, rather than believers in the
extraordinary.

I love the question.
I’ve never held anything in mind regarding Void. It’s like when rain falls on my face: I can’t see
it, I can’t count the drops, but there is a something recognizable about the whole of it.

# Excerpt from the Blue Cliff Record, Case 86 by ThatKir
  in zen

Music to my ears.

# Excerpt from the Blue Cliff Record, Case 86 by ThatKir
  in zen

I was thinking of something along these lines:
    All these phenomena are intrinsically void and yet this Mind with which they are identical is
    no mere nothingness. By this I mean that it does exist, but in a way too marvellous for us to
    comprehend. It is an existence which is no existence, a non-existence which is nevertheless
    existence. So this true Void does in some marvellous way ‘exist’. — Huangpo

# Excerpt from the Blue Cliff Record, Case 86 by ThatKir
  in zen

Is it the nothing that is Void — all things being Mind — or the nothing that divides between is and
is not? What somebody is reported to have said long ago is just an echo.

# Excerpt from the Blue Cliff Record, Case 86 by ThatKir
  in zen

For example, in Arabic there is the nothingness of a candle held up to the sun; the nothingness of
a quiet room ripe for the least sound; and the nothingness of non-existence: both actual and
potential.

# Chonk of Hsin Hsin Ming by [deleted] in zen

Greetings, AB!
Then we have two meanings at play: meaning through being (an Apple nourishes, independent of belief
or acknowledgement) and meaning through ascription. An interesting vein to explore.
    things have no meaning nor not no meaning...
We should retire this kind of non-speech. Silence communicates the exact same.

# Chonk of Hsin Hsin Ming by [deleted] in zen

    There is a point where a perceiving that nothing intrinisically matters might occur.
This still sounds like a nihilistic easy-way-out. Erasing all meaning from perception doesn’t mean
the dog doesn’t care if you feed him, or what you feed him. Taking a walk off a cliff has a
different meaning than down a garden path. Even the old worthies did not treat all goods as
fungible.

# Amazon by Xihr
  in finance

“Price is what you pay, value is what you get.” — Buffet
Asking what Amazon is actually worth is a tricky question, because you also have to account for
future markets and growth and technological advances we haven’t seen yet. All this is part of the
price of a stock.
At the same time, people will pay for a stock based solely on what they think might happen (“it
will go up again!”) or what has happened recently (“it just went down!”).
I can’t tell you what Amazon should be priced at, or will be worth, in the near term or long term.
But I own plenty of their stock and like their business model, even if the stock market as a whole
is pricing things a bit optimistically.
At the end of the day you have to hit the books and understand all the numbers and their
implications, or you’ll be stuck with the analysis of others. There’s really no shortcut if you
want to invest in individual companies. Hence why so many choose indexed ETFs as a much simpler way
to share in the success of the US market.

or on the heap, lexical scoping, extent, ownership, and memory layout. I believe you can be quite
happy in Python without knowing any of these things at all.

# Hey, Option Sellers! by boldPlayIm

It really depends on sector volatility and my general outlook on the market. If I really want to
own the stock no matter what, I’ll choose further out to increase premium, cashing out at 50-75%
profit before expiration if that should occur. If I’m betting on recovery after an exaggerated
earnings drop (or vice versa), I’ll choose a shorter timeframe because I’m betting on the short
term correction, but don’t have a solid idea of what performance will be over the next several
weeks.
I tend to sell puts at longer DTE than (covered) calls, because I find there’s more chance of
losing out on upside than the added premium accounts for. Market swings tend to outpace market
expectations in my preferred sector (technology).

influenced. You generate a sense of reality, and use the cycle of thought and feeling to cement
that illusion. Why? Because you’re not ready for the alternative. The Void is like stepping off a
cliff on a moonless night; except it’s only a cliff because you think it is.

# Question about Leverage by Sebtrades
  in options

Most investments (in stocks) aren’t likely to move much more than two standard deviations on a
given day, so some people calculate their require margin based on such a maximum daily drawdown
limit. This is how margin requirements are calculated for TD Ameritrade accounts that have
Portfolio Martin enabled.
For example, in Forex my leverage is 50:1, so I use $200 to control $10,000. There is a risk of
losing $9,800 more than my investment, but then again, major governments aren’t likely to collapse
all at once in a single day, so my computed margin risk is much lower, more like $3,000. However,
as the price moves against me, I may need to shore up the account to stay within that margin limit,
or else close out the position at the current loss.

the highest delta you can get. If you’re right, you buy back the call and realize the profit. If
you’re wrong, you basically sold the stock, but won’t transfer the shares until expiration.

A CD is a Certificate of Deposit. It's effectively a promissory note from a bank to pay you back on
a certain date at a certain rate of interest. It should be about as reliable as the bank itself.
You need to wait until the date of maturity, however, unless you buy it through a brokerage (like
TD Ameritrade) that allows you to sell it as a tradable security. I think ordinarily there is a
penalty for early liquidation at the bank.

# Manifestation of God/Holy Spirit/Maid of Heaven Uncreated? by parentscooking in bahai

This is actually a fairly subtle point, as evidenced by the volume of words you've received in
response. It concerns the station of the Primal Will, and how it came into being. The Báb writes:
    Bear thou witness ... that verily God, glorified be He, hath ever been, and will ever exist
    without anything to exist with Him. He verily hath created all things by virtue of His Will
    (Mashiyyah), and hath created the Will by Itself, out of nothing else.... All things are
    created and affected by It.
When you think of God "creating" something, it necessarily binds the created with the Creator in a
relationship where both parties are existent: first there was one, now there are two. However, the
initial "sprinkling from the clouds of Unknowing" -- the origin of the Will -- does not follow this
mundane concept of creation, since in those terms we think of "firstness" and "beginning", yet the
Primal Will is independent of these. The Báb also writes:
    It is this Primal Will which appeareth resplendent in every Prophet and speaketh forth in every
    revealed Book. It knoweth no beginning, inasmuch as the First deriveth its firstness from It;
    and knoweth no end, for the Last oweth its lastness unto It.
I have no handy analogy to describe the Uncreated. Countless mystical books will take you to the
door of this thought, but remain silent thereafter. It defies all words and concepts:
    Such is the state of the wayfarers in this Valley; but the people of the Valleys above this see
    the end and the beginning as one; nay, they see neither beginning nor end, and witness neither
    “first” nor “last.” Nay rather, the denizens of the undying city, who dwell in the green garden
    land, see not even “neither first nor last”; they fly from all that is first, and repulse all
    that is last. For these have passed over the worlds of names, and fled beyond the worlds of
    attributes as swift as lightning. Thus is it said: “Absolute Unity excludeth all attributes.”
    And they have made their dwelling-place in the shadow of the Essence.

I wish I’d learned a few things about time management early on, realistic goal setting, how to

enthusiasm to those you might work with. Some of that comes naturally to some people, others never
really learn it. Finding a good mentor is as important as choosing a school.
But above all, take it as your own personal responsibility to succeed — always. Even when nothing
is fair or going your way. Never wait for anyone else to tell you what to do or when to do it.
Asking help of others is great, but you must believe in your heart that the buck stops with you.

there are cheaper ways.
Figure out what drives you first, then take a look at all the different ways you could achieve the
same end. Money is rarely the answer, even if it’s sometimes an effective tool. But more often I
think it’s used as a substitute for self reflection.

# Is ETFs apocalypse possible? by MollyS84
  in StockMarket

EFTs can fail, in which case the assets remaining are divided and paid out. From one source on the
Web:
    Eric Balchunas, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, notes that during the past five
    years, 1,050 ETFs have launched. During the same period, more than 900 ETFs have folded. Their
    average lifespan is just 3.4 years.
On ETFs folding:
    Like mutual funds, ETFs may fall under duress if it can no longer validate the expense of
    operations through investor fees. As an ETF loses assets, the fund will lose investors,
    increasing the cost of operating per investor. If the fund is not able to recover the lost
    interest, it may have to close down. Nevertheless, the closing of an ETF is an orderly and
    efficient process, and investors are given plenty of warning so they can act accordingly.
    Before providers close the shutters on their ETFs, investors are notified three to four weeks
    prior to the stop date, and in the meantime, the ETF will still operate as usual during normal
    trading hours. In the event a firm shuts down an ETF, investors have one of two choices: sell
    your position before the final trading date, or wait for the fund to close and the check to
    come in. This can create tax consequences, and no investor likes surprises.

I'm not aware of this having a name, but it almost fits the definition of a "Straddle vs. Put: 3

I've modeled your proposal to see what the effect on risk/reward is: It increases maximum loss in

However, you won't be able to sell one of these; it will be a debit strategy, hence the increased
maximum loss.
# Selling a ITM put, hedging it with a lower ITM put? by STOPeatingSUGARS

This is called a credit spread. You earn the credit for the sale, with your risk being the

# This is a matter for strong people: another official AMA from WanderingRoninXIII by [deleted] in

The practice of Zen is like having a worm in your brain, eroding concepts and leaving you with the
realization that most of your motives in life are just as vapid and misdirected as you had feared.
When you’ve spent half a life building up and relying on concepts, how the hell is popping that
balloon supposed to leave you with any sense of how to face tomorrow? You’ve invested a whole
education in a world you know how to maneuver within. None of that prepares you for what’s sitting
in the mirror.

# Questions on Covered Calls by RumpleMy_Stiltskin
  in thinkorswim

Say you have 100 XYZ that you bought at $100. Then you sell a call at $110 for, say, $0.90. You
collect $90 premium, and this is yours to keep.
If the stock is anywhere under $110, nothing happens and you're $90 richer. If it's $110 or above,
the contract will expire and your broker will assign you the CALL, which means they'll sell your
shares at $110. You keep $90 + $10 * 100, or $1,090. This is your max possible profit on this
equity+option position: No matter how much higher than $110 the shares go, you still only get
$1,090.
A few weeks ago I bought 1k shares of BAC, and then sold 10 CALL contracts ATM, expecting it to go
lower. Well, it didn't. I had to watch the value of those shares reach over $4k without being able
to sell (because I didn't want to hold naked call options). In the end I made $90 off that trade,
but whoever bought the call from me made several thousand. But this is how it goes.

# Can anyone explain Forex market trading? by [deleted] in investing

Forex is legit, but there’s a disproportionate amount of total nonsense about it on the Web. I had
a hard time finding solid, reliable information about how to use Forex within a larger portfolio.
The great majority of what I encountered was snake oil: promising massive returns while failing to
mention that the losses could be just as massive.
What’s good and bad about Forex:
Leverage is great, so you don’t need to allocate a lot of capital, but use stop losses (or stop
limits) and cap your account size to maximum risk tolerance (a flash crash could result in
liquidation and closure, though it’s fairly rare).
There are no transaction fees and holding long/short are mostly equivalent: except that you pay (or
earn) interest for holding overnight. Right now, being long 50k GBP/USD costs ~$10/day.
There is volatility, but it’s usually pretty slow and is sometimes range bound, so you might see
your investment gyrate around 0 for several days. It’s nice knowing that your investment is
extremely unlikely to fall to zero. You’re betting on governments now, not companies. However,
leverage means that it could fall more than your total capital allotted.
While technical analysis is still useful, I find that you have to be a LOT more informed to
understand Forex movements. Many things can impact prices, in ways that defy a trivial analysis.
You’ll want to learn about the central banks, economics, commodity markets, the major economic
health indicators, and political news.
It’s not “free money” by any means, the way some YouTube people make it out to be. If anyone is
telling you they 4x’d their account in a year, best to ignore them. Or ask why they think the ECB

# FOREX by Litquidity88 in investing

When an event is this well expected beforehand, it’s not likely to cause a crash unless it happens
in a surprising way. There’s already a lot of shorting of pounds happening, which would mean plenty
of buying to cover after the fact.
To trade the market, you don’t trade the event, but the participants. What are the buyers and
sellers likely to do, and why? What is the Bank of England going to do after? Is that being priced
in?
No trading decision is ever obvious in advance. The only times you’ll know exactly what to do are
in the heat of the moment, when you notice something that other retail traders might be slow to
catch on to. But if it’s far in advance, the best you can do is formulate a plan and define your
risk limits. If you could be certain about such things, you’d have won the game.

Just guessing here, but since I’m assuming you didn’t have ~$7 million to secure the put, they sold
protection for capital to close the ITM short. However, the other side didn’t exercise all of its
contracts to sell. As the option holder, they can decide how many contracts to close, but your
broker didn’t know it would be a partial closure before selling protection. Now it would seem
you’re short 10,200 shares, and should buy to cover at the earliest opportunity, Monday pre-market.
I would think the lack of closure is due to your contracts being spread among several individuals,
some of whom had higher exercise costs than $0.03/contract would net them.

forces, news, earnings reports, the actions of institutional investors, people’s opinions, Twitter,
etc. Literally anything can change a person’s outlook on how well Wal*mart will do in sales
tomorrow, which could generate a buy or sell impulse. Multiply this by millions, and the fact that
such buying and selling itself influences the market. It’s a huge feedback loop based on real and
imagined events, rational and irrational behavior, hopes and fears. In the aggregate this leads to
trends for a variety of reasons, and certain patterns that investors attempt to capitalize on.

Do yourself a favor and don't buy options expiring in a week. You can thank me later.
# Making money selling options by nickwantsfree
  in options

There are a few strategies for making money selling options:
- Sell cash secured puts to buy stock. You always make money doing this, though you may hold stock
at lower than market afterward. So pick a stock that's worth it.
- Sell put credit spreads at high (relative) IV when things are rising or neutral. If you're
probability is 70%, and it's priced right, you'll make, for example, $300 7/10 times, and lose $700
3/10 times. However, probabilities are over-estimated by the market. Back-testing research done by
Option Alpha shows that the actual probability _over time_ is nearer 83%. Is this pulling pennies
from a steamroller? Maybe, if you were expecting huge returns from every trade. But it can be
consistent income.
- Sell call credit spreads at high (relative) IV when things are falling or neutral.
- Sell straddles if you expect movement, rolling for credit when you need more time.
- Sell covered calls on stock that you're assigned, if you expect fluctuation under your break-even
price (which in turn effectively adjusts the cost basis downward). In markets like the one we have
now, I sell and close covered calls on the same equities several times a week.
The thing with selling premium is that several factors work in your favor: vega, theta, and
neutrality in the underlying (in addition to beneficial movement). In the case of CSP and CC, your
worst outcomes are stock ownership, or exiting at breakeven. You're exchanging open-ended profit
for a wider range of successful outcomes.

# Do y'all have a general rule as to when to sell your earnings straddles? by utnapishtim_guy  in
options

Having a strategy is essential: Not only because it defines your risk and probabilities, but also
because it defines the meaning of success and failure.
If your strategy is to make 50% on a straddle, and you get out at 50%, that's all you need to know.
Count your win. And if you're going to count your missed gains, be sure to also count your missed
losses, and weigh them against each other.
Maybe... your strategy can be improved to either increase the win rate, or increase profit sizes.
But before making such a change, backtest to see if the increased risk really wins in the long run.
Nearly all of my major losses have resulted from allowing emotion -- fear, greed, over-confidence,
bias -- to undermine my chosen strategy. So much so that nowadays, I don't count my wins in terms
of dollars; I count them in terms of holding to my strategy throughout the trade, since doing so
consistently has always generated better returns in the long run than rolling the dice.
# Down more than 50%.....Help please by chavingia
  in investing

If you're down because of the events of the past two weeks, I wouldn't worry overly much.
9k is 9k, and whether it grows in Microsoft or it grows in wherever you have it now, growth is
growth. What you have to ask yourself is: is it a quality company that can weather market swings;
does it have solid fundamentals and good management; is it something you'd be willing to hold for
10 years or longer? If not, why is it a good place for your money? If you're trying to get rich
quick, most people just get poor even quicker.

# I want to invest weekly without having to research much, what do you guys recommend? by [deleted]
in investing

If you have a date you want the money by, say 2050, then Fidelity (and probably other companies)
offer mutual funds that are geared towards this sort of approach.
For example, if saving for 30 years from now, you could put the money into the 2050 index fund (the
non-managed version) monthly, which Fidelity then invests in ~80% stocks and ~20% other asset
classes. As the years roll by, they'll automatically shift the portfolio towards more and more
stable assets. By 2050, the fund is mostly bonds or treasuries or money market, expecting that
you'll want a stable money supply by that time rather than growth.
Since it's a mutual fund you can withdraw at any time, but it might be a reasonable place to stuff
your money while you're learning. Otherwise, just browse the ETF market and pick something around
your desired risk tolerance.

# Which expiration date to buy? by JustAleagueplayer

If you have the capital, go _at least_ 60 days out, otherwise you're racing against the clock as
your option suffers from theta decay quicker each day. I made such a mistake recently, and am
preparing to book the loss in a week or two. Usually the only reason I would buy near expiry is
that my belief is high and the premium is low enough that I'm willing to give it up (which usually
ends up being the case). Otherwise, I prefer far out LEAPs (Jan/Jun 21), which give me lots of time
to ride out fluctuations — even major market moves that take months to resolve.

Looking at the prices on https://www.macrotrends.net/1333/historical-gold-prices-100-year-chart,

then triple, and now ~4x for the last ten years. Who knows how much higher it could go up, though
it doesn't tend to only go down for a few years before returning higher. Some articles you might

You're right, losses are the price of education — if we learn and improve our principles and

successes. You might even say one cannot become a solid investor without loss; it's as bad weather
to a sailor.
Though I'm not sure I'd say it's not a loss until you pull out. It's definitely a loss in terms of
market value. Whether you believe it's still a worthwhile investment is a another question, and if
you think it's not anymore, the money is perhaps better transferred elsewhere. Or put this way: If
you lose $10k in value and hold, you have to believe your asset is capable of making at least $10k.
For a company with good fundamentals and track record, I usually have little trouble believing
that.
# Recession fears, recession reality by jwiegley in investing

If you have time to wait, for example if you don't need your money in the next ten to twenty years,
then an index ETF, or a blended mutual fund, is a reasonable way to go. Even if everything goes
crazy in the next 5 years and the market loses half its value, in the long run we're all betting
that civilization to continue to grow and develop. The top investors in the world aren't ceasing to
invest at times like this; but they aren't focusing their investments on market timing either. Even
though we had two big recessions in the past twenty years, if you had put money into Apple and
Microsoft at basically any point, and just held it out, you'd be doing great right now. The key is
not to panic, use dollar cost averaging to your advantage, and don't worry too much about money you
don't need to spend right away.

Theta meas that if you buy an option expiring soon, and SPY stays the same, your option will decay
in value to zero just from the passage of time. Time (or theta) decay accelerates toward
expiration, but is fairly flat up to 30-60 days prior. Also, time decay hurts you most if you buy
near the money options, since that is when it is highest in relation to the overall price of the
option.

# How do calls and puts work, why do people make or lose huge amounts on them, and are they worth

Buying calls and puts gives you leverage. For $1000 you could potentially make much, much more.
People lose lots of money when they get intoxicated by this leverage, and put down their whole life
savings for a potential huge return. Yet if the stock doesn't move the way you expect it to, your
options expire worthless and you lose everything.
A friend of mine tripled his total capital buying options. He then proceeded to lose everything he
had gained.
There are saner, far safer ways to use options, and lots you should be aware of before entering a
given option position. Not every use of options is equivalent to rolling dice.

# Opportunity costs and Buy-Hold by crosmaxal in investing

Another thing you can do is sell and repurchase downward. That is, if you buy at a high and the
underlying crashes — and you see a trend that's likely, in your belief, to continue downward — then
sell half. If it goes down further, buy back in and adjust your cost basis. If it keeps going up,
count the loss today and wait longer to recoup, or decide it's too uncertain and shift to another
investment. I just did this with AMZN while writing this.
Money you lose is fully gone, realized or not. The only question to ask yourself is if you believe
the asset you hold still has value. If it does, and you think you can make money on it, *that's the
sole reason to keep holding it*. Thus, at the start of each day -- say you're down $10k -- ask
yourself, "Will my current holdings earn me $10k, or should I be investing elsewhere?" If you think
that lost $10k is "yours" and is sitting somewhere waiting to come back to you, this is what leads
you to sunk cost thinking and missed opportunities.

During a bubble, when growth is sky high, there is more spending on credit than on cash generated
from productivity. This must at some point lead to a time when more money is spent on reducing debt
than on purchases. Since much of that money will come from selling assets that were likely bought
at higher price, it can depress the market at scale, and lead to a constant decrease in growth as
the economy corrects for earlier inflationary spending.

Selling covered calls is best in a neutral market, in my opinion. If it goes up too much, you keep

Your platform should tell you what the market’s expected point move is at expiration. For a 90
point move, you’ll have to go out many months, maybe even years, depending on the stock.

that’s part of how the prices are determined. People pay you a premium when they believe you’re
taking on more risk than they are.

# Path to learning options by CrazyAnchovy

If you’re selling a call on stock that you own and it’s bullish, you will sell the stock. You
always keep the premium, no matter what. If you’re selling a call and you don’t own the stock, and
you’re bullish... then I’m not sure if you know the risk profile of writing naked calls. Perhaps
you could say more, because I feel that I don’t have the whole picture.
In general you’d buy a call if you’re bullish, sell a call if you’re bearish or neutral, and the
reverse for puts. Selling puts carries the risk of assigning stock, while selling calls carries the
risk of having to sell stock (which, if you don’t already have it, is potentially unlimited risk).

# Beginner question about calls by IS_JOKE_COMRADE
  in options

Delta is a measure of how much the price of your asset will change with every point move in the
underlying. Stock has a delta of 1, so a point of movement is a point of increase or decrease in
value. Gamma measures how much delta will change after each such movement.

Deep in the money options can also have a delta of 1. In this case, you’re buying them for leverage
— meaning, you can experience 1000 shares worth of movement for what 50 shares might cost, for
example — or to take advantage of increases in volatility, which can also affect the value of
options. The trade off is that you might be wrong, and the option expires worthless, losing all of
your money. This is always the maximum risk for buying options, so avoid over-committing, no matter
how much you think the stock will move in your favor. Or, if you like that sort of thing, head over
to /r/WallStreetBets.

If this seems too complicated, then definitely, buy and sell stock. In fact, find really good
companies, and during big market downturns like we just had, buy stock and hold it. There are many
examples of this working out wonderfully.

Options can be quite complex, but they offer tremendous flexibility, and can allow you to profit
safely — that is, with fixed risk — in every kind of market: bull, bear or neutral. You can create
positions that will work to your advantage in a majority of outcomes, and where you even have a
decent chance of knowing the probabilities in advance. I roughly do half of my trading in options
(buying and selling), a lot of stock, options on futures, and then futures themselves. They all
have their strengths and weaknesses, and demand study and sticking to well-formulated strategies,
or else you’re much better off putting it in a mutual fund and walking away.

# Beginner question about calls by IS_JOKE_COMRADE

You can also pay less premium by buying deep in the money, which also has higher delta. This allows

# Radical Skepticism/Solipsism by Kai-Likes-Sleep  in zen

Truth is a concept, a proof that something is well defined based on what you’re willing to accept.

The apple is not true, nor does it exist. It is a name for what you hold in your hand. For example,
you think that the apple occupies a clearly defined space, but your ability to smell is because its
molecules also permeate the surrounding air. The distinction between “apple” and “not apple“ is one
you chose based on your senses, not one that evidently is.

Commonsense truths are shorthands, and many of them are wrong in greater contexts. The appearance
of objects is also a function of time, of probabilities continually in electro-static
juxtaposition. We impose the normal on the incredible, and call it the plain truth.

# How do you prove that god exists ? by -religious_atheist-  in bahai

If by “prove” you mean a demonstrable reduction of the statement to some set of axioms within a
logical system, I would say God’s existence can never be proven, unless you already take his
existence to be an axiom.

But if by “prove” you mean sufficient anecdotal experience to convince oneself that religious text
has a preternatural source, that’s always going to be very personal, and such proofs often do not
transfer from person to person.

# 250k to sell cash covered puts by Ashkerz89  in options

I like the clarification, thank you.

# 250k to sell cash covered puts by Ashkerz89  in options

Not according to Investopedia, which states:

    Naked options refer to an option sold without any previously set-aside shares or cash to
    fulfill the option obligation at expiration.

https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nakedoption.asp

# 250k to sell cash covered puts by Ashkerz89  in options

Naked here means that your position isn’t covered by cash or equity, so if the position moves
against you, you could be facing a margin call.

# SPX vs. /ES by OKImHere  in options

/ES has different tax implications, I believe. Also, keep aware of futures contract rollover dates.
An SPX option 60 DTE will be priced off current values, while the /ES contracts are based on next
month predictions, which might be higher or lower than current market. This makes sense when you
consider that /ES options are a triple derivative from the underlying stocks, while SPX options are
only a double derivative.

# Christian Baha’is by virusalii  in bahai

Having studied historical Christianity a bit, my temptation is to ask, “which Bible?”, but in my

Bible tells me, even if sometimes I disagree with modern interpretations of what it means. The text
is of divine origin.

# Time to share some investing wisdom by gvalles8  in SecurityAnalysis

Trade your whole account, not individual positions. If you lose $5k on one position, and gain $6k
on another, you didn't lose anything. While it sounds obvious, psychologically it has been a major
shift for me to think of my entire liquidity and cost basis rather than getting hung up on the
losing or winning character of individual choices. This may also naturally lead you toward
diversifying and hedging more.

Don't underestimate opportunity cost. Holding onto a loser because you don't want to fail one
position could be costing you way more in missed opportunities elsewhere. Keep your capital in the
right places.

Make goals, and calibrate your happiness to meeting them. If your cousin says that he made $2mm on
a wild bet, just congratulate him and be glad that you beat your goals while understanding both how
and why.

# Collecting premium like it’s unemployment by comboverice  in options

It's more conservative, and it's what I would use instead of a short strangle, but "better" depends
on your objectives and appetite for risk. I don't think any options strategy is better or worse
than any other in absolute terms.

# Collecting premium like it’s unemployment by comboverice  in options

A short strangle is just a jade lizard with no long call option. It’s less safe, but nets more
premium (and benefits a bit more from theta and IV drop) at the cost of having enormous upside risk
if the underlying should shoot the moon.

# Can someone Explain The Greeks? by kru_pharaoh  in options

If it's high delta, it's a bit like holding a stock. Also, higher delta has a higher chance of
expiring in the money.

If it's high gamma the price of the option will tend to whip around. Gamma is usually highest on
the day of expiration.

Theta ramps up exponentially toward expiration, and eats away at the extrinsic value of your option
day by day.

IV mainly reflects how risky people think the option is to hold, and Vega tells you how quickly
that sentiment tends to change. If people are panicky and unsure, bullish one day bearish the next,
both will be high, and the price of the option will be high to match.

There are many other greeks, both 2nd and 3rd order and combinations of these, but knowing them in
detail is usually important for particular trading strategies. If you have an intuition for the
four mentioned above, you'll do much better than people who wonder why the price moved in their
direction, but they lost money anyway.

# Can someone explain how time decay gets removed with a vertical call spread by 01Cloud01  in

# Understanding long gamma by InsideAnalysis  in options

When you are long gamma, moves upward in the underlying will be accelerated (since the positive

The short and long legs of the spread are negative and positive theta and vega (or conversely).
They rarely cancel each other out entirely, but it’s definitely better in that respect to only
being long.

# Turning logic into faith by Cordath  [+1] in bahai

Marriage is a great suggestion, if you find a good partner who understands you and your
aspirations. I'd like to offer some advice, though, on the matter itself.

I grew up with a pretty strong case of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder -- as in I felt the need to
touch door frames a certain number of times before I could pass through them without anxiety. So I
know what you mean by the struggle between low compulsions and high intentions. I've also had a few
decades to think about it in the context of the Bahá’í Writings and becoming a functioning member
of the community.

First and foremost, you didn't choose this. God gives us our preferences and inclinations. Society
makes it FAR worse than it would have been in a simpler age. What matters now is how we cope with
the challenge. But I want you to take yourself off the hook for the mere existence of the challenge
itself. Nothing bad or evil about yourself lead to this moment. Some of us are just prone to
addictive behavior. (If I had ever touched a cigarette in my youth, I'd be a hopeless chain smoker
right now).

The steed of the first valley is patience, and it is a very profound sort of patience. Even if you
find that your journey would last a hundred thousand years, it says you should not falter. Imagine
that! We have to become so assured of God's love, support and grace, that even the thought of
dwelling for a hundred millennia in our poor condition would not dissuade us in the least. This is
something to meditate on.

The "logic" you mention: I've also observed that divine knowledge tends to pass in phases through
us. First it informs the mind and our understanding; then it transforms our vision and what we're
able to see; then it affects the heart and our sensibilities; and finally it manifests in our
behavior and reactions to the world. It can take a long time for wisdom to move from the Writings
on the page to this final step. I've been working on, "If they poison your lives, sweeten their
souls," my entire life.

Your desire to soar in the heavens of purity and chastity: that's who you really are. Yes, the body
weighs you down, but as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá said, "The spiritual world bestows only the joy! If we suffer
it is the outcome of material things..." Strive to shift your self-identification to these
aspirations, the things that are conducive to joy. The rest is simply not who you are: it's your
momentary condition. And as your identity moves toward the spiritual, you should find you cannot
hate this because it is pure accident. Let that hate become pity and then compassion, and finally
mercy toward others who also suffer from it. You are fighting the true Jihad now, and it calls for
warriors of outstanding resolve: not in the sense of strictness, but of overflowing spirit.

# A friendly reminder from an experienced veteran: No matter how cool the strategy name sounds, any
strategy that adds additional legs to a trade merely shifts around your risk/return profile; it
does not improve your edge. by FullDiamondArmor23  in thetagang

This is a good reminder! Every strategy is an amalgam of buying and selling puts and/or calls and/
or the underlying. In fact, the more complex a strategy gets, the more different ways you can see
it (long stock + synthetic short = collared put + naked short call = put + covered call). And those
all describe the exact same position; with equivalents its possible to replicate risk/reward using
different types of positions altogether, where you're now shifting around premium costs, expiration
dates, theta or vega exposure, tail risks, etc.

At the end of the day one should endeavor to understand any strategy in terms of its basic
elements, and avoid the specialness of names, which as OP puts: don't endow the strategy with
anything special.

# A question about free-will, where does it come from? by diogov9  in bahai

Human beings approach the unknown by referencing what is familiar. So at times we've thought of the
universe as being naturalistic, animistic, mechanistic, computational, a product of probabilities,
etc. All of these are "wrong", but each is a better approximation than the last, allowing us to
utilize the potentialities of the world we inhabit.

I think the question of free-will and the nature of God's omniscience is no different. If you
consider that the limitations we're subject to may not even be a part of that truth, it allows for
some pretty wild ideas to emerge.

I find the sweet spot is 30-60 DTE, so that you get a bit of delta (read: swing with the

Example of the lunch I mean: naked sell 1600 8/17 TSLA calls right now for $220. Or sell 1600/1630
credit spreads for $10 each x22. Profit is $220 if expiring <$1600 in both cases, but the spreads

# Do debit spreads work? by MadScientist700  in options

Debit spreads work just like cheaper calls or puts that have been "capped", with correspondingly

# Are we really in a tech bubble? by Saladin19  in investing

For example, someone who is older, who wishes to avoid short-term capital gains tax, who wants
regular income through dividends, who wants some assurance that their invested capital will also
grow to beat inflation in addition to these dividends — may have quite different objectives from
someone who is young, can easily earn to replace losses, has no problem with higher taxes (because
their bracket is already low), has the time to actively manage their positions, etc.

Yes, gains are gains, but investors can differ greatly in their style, outlook and needs.

Why would you be against central banking? They effectively act as a liquidity manager for the

looking at now were stacked up years before this years disaster, such as when rates were being
lowered even while values and employment were extremely strong. It may have been prudent to weaken
the dollar when the rest of the world was turning recessionary, but it left us without much room to
manuever.

# How much time does a trader have to react to news before the equity price sees an immediate price
crash or spike? by sawarbrand  in investing

You'll never beat the algos, who will always have reacted before you gain access to the same news.
In general -- just basing on personal observation -- I find you have about an hour from first
release to when the majority of retail traders will catch up with the news, and then a few hours
for most everyone else. It's enough time to make some profit, but never enough time to really
capitalize on the bulk of the move, unless you made some right predictions in advance.

I wouldn't do this. When the day comes and those shares are worth $15 million, is he friend enough
to hand them over, when you may not have a strong legal claim to the shares?

You would have to ensure the options are transferred to you legally, but the company may not allow
such rights to their employee. From https://corporate.findlaw.com/business-operations/
transferable-employee-stock-options.html:

    Employers commonly grant stock options to employees, either in the form of "incentive stock
    options" ("ISOs") or "nonqualified stock options " ("NSOs"). ISOs offer employees certain tax
    benefits and are subject to qualification requirements under the Internal Revenue Code ("IRC").
    (IRC §422.) Among other things, ISOs are subject to a general prohibition against transfer,
    although ISOs may be transferred to an employee's beneficiaries (including the employee's
    estate) upon the employee's death. (IRC §422(b)(5).) An option that is transferred (or
    transferable) during the employee's lifetime, whether by its original terms or by subsequent
    amendment, will not qualify as an ISO but will instead be treated as an NSO for tax purposes.

# Wash Sale On Options by leastneutralanswer  in investing

It's not a wash sale yet, but is pending. If there had been another lot purchased between the first
one and the losing sale, or if you purchase another lot within 30 days of the losing sale, then the
wash sale amount (the loss) should be applied to the cost basis of the second purchase.

From https://fairmark.com/investment-taxation/capital-gain/wash/wash-sales-and-options/:

    Congress amended the wash sale rule in 1988 so that it applies directly to contracts or options
    to buy or sell stock or securities. That means you can have a wash sale when you close an
    option position at a loss, if you establish a replacement position within the wash sale period.
    The Treasury has yet to issue regulations under this rule, and a host of questions remain
    unanswered. Foremost among these is the question of when one option is substantially identical
    to another option.

# What are the risks of covered calls by weballinweballin  in thetagang

If the underlying will eventually turn around, then at some point in the future you’ll expire OTM.
Also, even if you only do it once, you’re lowering your cost basis when you get assigned.

Downside is that you’re exposing yourself to wider swings, due to adding more time. And your
capital used to secure the put is tied up longer.

I generally prefer to accept the assignment and start writing calls, but if things are dropping
faster than I expected I will roll.

# Risk in Covered Calls by Conscious_Ad_8889  in options

Welcome to the joy of options. :)

The real risk is that you miss out on the day when it goes up 20% due to some news or announcement.
It happens. But the rest of the time, it works very much like you've described. I've been making
bank on DIS and SHAK calls, but haven't sold the underlying shares in four months.

# Petition to sticky a warning on selling calls on NKLA by seppes94  in thetagang

Sure, but I thought the whole issue at hand was ending up with a larger obligation than the account
could bear. If it’s a cash secured put, my opinion changes.

# Petition to sticky a warning on selling calls on NKLA by seppes94  in thetagang

Yes, true. I too prefer naked put risk to naked call, though I strive to avoid being naked ever.

# Petition to sticky a warning on selling calls on NKLA by seppes94  in thetagang

A put credit spread has similar risks. If you are ITM on the short leg, but not the long, and get
assigned, you may be forced to borrow on margin to buy the shares.

# Petition to sticky a warning on selling calls on NKLA by seppes94  in thetagang

I'm not sure there even is a fee for easy to borrow stocks. Here's what I found on TD Ameritrade:

    Shorting a stock allows you to sell something you don’t own, so traders must understand the
    regulatory requirements. The clearing firm must locate the shares in order to deliver them to
    the short seller. Shares may be hard to borrow because of high demand, a small number of
    outstanding shares (“float”), or increased securities volatility. If the stock loan department
    is unable to deliver the shares for settlement, it may call for a “buy-in,” meaning the
    borrower must buy the shares in the open market to cover the position. If the stock price has
    increased, the borrower will lose money.

    Also, borrowers of certain “hard-to-borrow” (HTB) shares may be subject to an additional fee in
    order to compensate the stock loan department for the cost of locating and maintaining its
    supply of such HTB shares. If you open and close a short position intraday (meaning you don’t
    hold it overnight), you will not be subject to a fee. However, if you hold the position longer,
    an HTB fee, based on the notional value of the short position and the annualized HTB rate, will
    be assessed.

    How are HTB fees calculated? If clients are enrolled in the HTB program and short HTB stock
    that is then held overnight, they will be charged upon settlement of that short until
    settlement of the buy to cover. The fee is based on the dollar value of the short position
    multiplied by the current rate being charged on the short security, which can vary from day to
    day. It is quoted as a percentage of the value of the short position (such as -3.5%
    annualized). This rate is representative of the demand/price within the securities lending
    market. Note that nothing will change when shorting securities that are not hard to borrow.

# Petition to sticky a warning on selling calls on NKLA by seppes94  in thetagang

As you well know now, a credit spread is only one step down from a naked short, because of the way
it exposes you to early exercise and pin risk. A debit spread is a bit better, and a covered call
even better than that. It’s why you need level 3 to trade spreads.

I’m sorry this happened, and moreso that it was a shock. It really underscores how important it is
to know the risks involved!

# Petition to sticky a warning on selling calls on NKLA by seppes94  in thetagang

It’s based on availability of the shares to borrow. Some stocks are easy to borrow, others hard.
The harder it is for your broker to find shares, the more they’ll charge you for the loan.

For me it is the world’s most fascinating game, because the objective is simple (to make money),

skill, discipline, learning and experience acquired. It’s as much learning about and improving
yourself as the market. I love that it’s a game with real consequences, but how I play is entirely
up to me. I’m only competing with yesterday’s results, and P/L numbers never lie. Finally, when I

# I feel like I've made a mistake holding by Disastrous-Crow1  in investing

The market can be a roller coaster, so don’t focus your emotions anywhere but the finish line. If
you’re up, you’re up, it doesn’t actually matter how you got there. Pretend your account only ever
went up if it helps.

This is why I set monthly targets. Doesn’t matter if I lose $10k in a day if I’m up by month’s end.
Your goal is the only number that matters.

That said, you also need to manage risk. Don’t chase losers or fall into the mindset of “trying to
get your money back from the market”. Given your current frame of mind I would GET OUT NOW and
regroup, get your head on straight, and think about more conservative investment since you’ll soon
have a need for free capital.

# Why do people assume their retirement funds will grow at least 6% per year? by LUCKIN_INVESTOR  in

# Market slippage on Futures? by fdjdsfgndsiufgsn  in thinkorswim

You’d have to close the trade at $100 loss, and not wait until maximum loss. Or be more
conservative, like sell PUTs on something like BAC and if it gets assigned, sell covered calls
against the position. This isn’t a big money maker, but it avoids losing too much capital since you
can always sit on the position and wait it out if things go too much against you.

Day trading isn’t necessarily and easy place to start out, since it needs both decent fundamental
and technical skills, plus a lot of stomach and discipline. Perhaps you’d have swing trading or
position trading a bit gentler to start?

# Market slippage on Futures? by fdjdsfgndsiufgsn  in thinkorswim

Your stop loss enters a market order once the condition is met. Depending on the current state of
the limit order book, there can be a gap between your stop loss condition and the next available
pending buy. Since we had a news event this evening, apparently no one had an order open until 8
ticks below your stop loss.

This is always the danger with stop losses; flash crashes can be even more damaging, resulting in
very large discrepancies. Thankfully they are rare, but they do happen.

# Running The Wheel: Short DTE and ATM by pantaloonsss  in options

# Nkla bear spread by upvotemeok  in options

This is what happens when your spread is near the money, because the probability of winning is

The further out you go, the lower the chances, but the better the profit if it happens. It’s not
impossible to find 3:1 or 4:1 in your favor.

For example, looking at July expiration, buying $30 and selling $20 should cost $250 to make $750,

Depends on what you expect. I have 30 days left on an S&P spread and I’m just going to wait and see

# Question about locking in profits by opening a debit spread by LevelIDrama  in options

# So the idea behind 45 dte for sellers, is there a time frame that benefits the buyer. by rchill
in options

It depends on a few too many factors for a simple answer. Closer to expiration sees the gamma curve
sharpen, meaning you experience greater moves per change in the underlying. If you buy a leap and
the stock jumps, for example, the percentage change in contract price is much less extreme.

But here lies the beauty of options: you can tune the risk according to your expectations.
Sometimes that means buying further out for a long-term leveraged play, or closer in for a riskier
profit multiplier.

# Selling UVXY covered call by [deleted] in options

If you feel strongly that it will go down, and you don't mind selling at the strike price, I
usually choose something near the money. If I think it could go either way, and I'd like to sell
higher, I go further out of the money. For expiration, usually a week out so that I don't speed a
month waiting on the outcome.

# What's the downside of covered calls? by flying_spaghetti_MD  in investing

You may be making a few assumptions there. I sell ATM or just OTM calls all the time without
capping upside very often, it depends on what's happening in the market. And the fund applies this
strategy constantly and consistently, something hard for emotional humans to maintain. I'm not
saying paying ETF fees is necessarily better, just don't assume a simple conception of what's
involved is the whole story.

# Will rolling always eventually get back a loss? by Michael12390  in thetagang

I assume we're talking about short calls or short puts?

For a put, if the underlying ultimately gains in value, and you have enough time, then yes. But
you'd lose the opportunity to use that capital for the entire period, and this could amount to more
than the immediate loss.

For a call, you'd need the rise in the stock not to outpace the rate at which you can roll. If it
stays flat long enough, then yes, you could catch up, but if not then you may never.

You can also flip positions. If you're rolling a short call and it looks like the rise in the
underlying will outstrip you, you can buy to cover and sell a put of equivalent value in the
future. I've done this four times this year, and recovered my losses on three of them during this
bull period. Just one more to go.

# Does the Fed really care about the stock market? by Jared_Yuen  in investing

If asset values decline, people’s ability to settle debts declines, which can lead to defaults or
less spending, which impacts income, which means fewer buyers and a further decline in assets.

I wouldn’t say the Fed cares about the market per se: they care about our connected economy that is
greatly affected by asset values.

Futures don’t pay dividends. They have an expiration date. They book gains and losses by the day.
There is no difference between being short or long. They can go negative, so risk either way is
unlimited. Getting full market data often requires paying a separate service than equities. There
are tons of boutique futures brokers. They trade 24/5, have different margin requirements,
different tax implications, different circuit breakers, and each tick up or down is usually more

# Experimented with put spreads and one of my legs got assigned. Need advise by [deleted] in options

Being assigned in this scenario, assuming you have enough capital, can be a good thing, since the
buyer of your put contract just forfeited any extrinsic value left in the short contract. If you
close the long put and equity positions, it’s the same as closing that spread, but without buying
back that extra premium from the short.

# I'm so confused with what the Federal Reserve is doing... by buzzbuzz999  in investing

The Fed effectively has an infinite money pool from which they can lend money by buying other’s
debt. The idea is that all the debt gets paid back eventually, so this money is credit injected
into the economy, not cash. You’re asking where they got all the cash from, but if your bar man
says, “Sure, you can pay me tomorrow,” he just created credit out of thin air in exchange for your
debt to him. And since the government is the number one seller of debt, you begin to realize how
they can spend way more than they take in in taxes. This is why it’s liquidity holding up the
markets (available capital), not actual wealth in the form of productivity. We’re borrowing from
our future.

# Selling to close a long call position fundamentals question by Desert_Hawg  in options

Someone else could be short the same contract that day, and you each cancel the other out. Your

A covered call, at its worst, is a premature sale.

Yes, because the capital/margin requirements are miniscule compared to an equity position. Now, I

success, but the pattern you establish over a lifetime. Give yourself at least a month or a year
before passing any kind of judgment, and even then, losses should lead to learning and risk
adjustment, and nothing else. You want to constantly and gradually get better at taking emotion out

# Boeing by Project-Health12  in stocks

An example of a use of options today: My Boeing position had a cost basis of $216.7. I sold to
close that position at $217 today, with the day’s high being $218. However, I still think it’s a
decent long-term prospect, I just don’t know what its immediate future will be, and my preference
is to be more in cash. So I compromised on this outlook by immediately selling the equivalent
number of puts at a strike price of 215. Because the volatility is so high on Boeing stock this
week, those puts sold for $22 on the contract. This means that if Boeing is under 215 by mid-July,
I’ll re-enter the same position with a new cost basis of $193. And if Boeing is above 215 by
mid-July, then I’ll have effectively sold my position at $237 instead of today’s $217. I feel that
this better balances my risk tolerance for this position, than a direct hold. BA is already back
down to $208.

Yes, you have it correct. If you enter a trailing stop loss order at $-1.50 MARK, current $25, and

market order to sell is entered at $1.50 less than whatever the highest price seen is.

# What would you do with $100k? by LoopOfRecursion  in investing

Agreed, if anything it confirms that one should learn this stuff for one’s self. The whole reason
I’m into investing now is because my step mother (a professional banker) saw my returns report and
helped me see me how garbage it was.

# What method of investing do you use in the stock market? by Zachary_See  in investing

Sell options, swing trade stocks and non-leveraged ETFs, buy option debit spreads.

# What would you do with $100k? by LoopOfRecursion  in investing

Move it to a brokerage and invest in 1/3 each of SPY, GLD and TLT, and then take the next six
months to a year to study trading and finance in my spare time until ready to make better
decisions. Or give it to a professional money manager, such as Morningstar instead of going into
those three ETFs.

# Any reason to not yolo and full commit to Disney stock? by JonnyQuickHands  in investing

# Options are confusing. by Daniel1197  in stocks

The option costs money, more than the difference between strike and price (the "intrinsic value"),
due to what's called "time value" or "extrinsic value". If you immediately exercise, you're
throwing away this value.

So if it's a one month option at $8.00, and current price is $8.35, say it's going to cost you
something like $0.60 to buy the option, meaning you'd lose $0.25 if you bought and immediately
exercised.

# Why not weeklies? by jjjsososo  in thetagang

I sell weeklies if I'm expecting the chance of entering the position is 50/50 and I'd rather trade
calls against the equity sooner rather than wait several weeks should the market move against me.
In that case it's about the liquidity or taking an equity position, rather than just maximizing
theta.

# How do you actually short a stock on TOS. Is it even possible? by Attorneyatsea  in thinkorswim

It’s not you, it’s their inability to find shares of the stock to borrow for you. Btw, just is case
you don’t realize it, there are usually high carrying costs for stocks that are hard to borrow,
which can bite into your profits if it takes a while for things to move your way. You probably know
this, but just in case. You may want to short a different way, like buying puts.

# Hedging with puts when running wheels by Bastcydon  in thetagang

The wheel doesn’t make tons of money, not like buying options can, so if you regularly buy to hedge

hedge in the way you’re suggesting, at most I’ll buy a put debit spread.

# I have an idea, and I would like some input by XIts_Me_Dio_X  in investing

As someone who largely skipped college (attended for a few years, but no degree), and succeeded
regardless, I will say that if you take advantage of it college can be extremely worthwhile. If I
could back in time, I would absolutely love another chance to attend college. It's not just about
preparing you to make money; it can change how you think, what you see, your ability to study,
learn and express yourself, and lead to relationships that last a lifetime. The fact that you're
thinking so narrowly about what college has to offer is a sign that you haven't yet experienced
what college has to offer. :)

# Covered Calls - Are they really as beneficial as this sub thinks they are? by iaravindkrishna  in
thetagang

I also use CCs for low risk, intraday directional bets. If I have 100 shares of XYZ, and a strong
reason to think it's going down, instead of shorting or buying a put I'll use a covered call to
capture some of that downside move. If I'm right I can often close near 50% usually within a few
hours. This week I did so with BA, SHAK, DIS, CRWD and BAC. Only BAC surprised me and gave up some
upside.

# Isn‘t it smart to both sell and buy a certain fluctuating stock/crypto? by molotowcock  in
investing

If you're right it is. Main risks are either that stock ends up flat all the way to expiration
(trades in a narrow range), or it moves only in one direction. Although, in the case of options, if
it moves far enough in that one direction you could still win.

# active trader puts stop orders but i only want limit orders. by SneakyPrick  in thinkorswim

I think if you hold down Control when you click in the price ladder, it changes to a limit order.
You may need to enable this in the preferences. It should indicate this to you when you hold down
Control.

# What happens to Short Orders? by Coolio_Street_Racer  in investing

I'm not entirely sure what you mean by a short order. Do you mean you've shorted a stock, and have
a stop loss to buy to close, but may not have the money to close at that level? What should happen
then is the same as any margin call: You either increase capital or the broker will liquidate.

# Isn‘t it smart to both sell and buy a certain fluctuating stock/crypto? by molotowcock  in
investing

In options trading we call this "buying a straddle". You both profit and lose in either direction.
If you believe that the underlying will vacillate, you sell the side that profits and then wait
until the other side profits, and win twice.

credit like crazy until the amount is so low, the number flips over in their computers and you end
up a gazillionaire. Can’t fail.

# Strategies for trading options? by 60svintage  in options

The simplest one I use most: if I decide I want to buy a stock, and the price I want to pay, then I
sell a <14 DTE put at that price, along with a limit order to buy it back at 50% possible profit.
Of all the strategies I use, this offers the best range of positive outcomes (for me, since I
wanted to buy anyway), and has had the most consistent P/L over time. The choice of stock is the
most important factor, and selling contracts during negative markets (not after a huge upswing when
everyone is wanting to buy).

# Alright, FOMO got me by Train3rRed88  in stocks

When FOMO strikes is when you need a set of indicators to help you distinguish impulse buys/sells
from a trade with DD.

To give an example: I sold DIS at 121 on Monday, and when it popped back to 122, FOMO began to hit.
Same with LUV. But then I checked the technicals, and nearly all of them were showing negative
signs for DIS (RSI, DMI, Keltner bands, put/call ratio, market forecast, declining volume against
rising prices, and an order book often stronger on the sell side). So, against my wishes I decided
to instead sell ATM covered calls on the remaining DIS, since signs are pointing toward a
retraction to 110. The recent bump was enthusiastic on reopening, but not strong on fundamental
causes.

# There goes Tech and the bear rally, boys. Predicting declines tomorrow for the market broadly

Not arguing with the longer term bear sentiment! I keep freeing up more cash by the day.

# Losses. by Baykah21  in stocks

Taking losses earlier is one of my main areas to improve this year, that and better position
sizing.

You have to decide on your loss limit before you enter the trade, not after. If it's hit, your
analysis was wrong and it's time to get out and research another trade. In fact, getting out when
it hits your well-reasoned stop can allow you to re-enter at an even lower price.

Some stocks I've held for a year before they recovered their value. Had I sold those stocks at a
loss -- whether 10, 20 or 30% loss -- I still could have re-entered all of them when they were 50
and 60% down due to COVID.

So you don't know what will happen, but you do know what you think will happen, which is why you
entered the trade in the first place. If that thinking turns out to be wrong, don't think of it as
a loss, think of as a chance to change up your trade for a more effective one. Even if it means
continuing to trade the same ticker afterward.

You'll think differently once you're out and give yourself some time for the emotions to drain out.
It doesn't feel good, and often causes my enthusiasm for study to wane for a few hours/days/weeks,
but that's the game.

# There goes Tech and the bear rally, boys. Predicting declines tomorrow for the market broadly

Tech being hit by a news cycle could just mean flows into other sectors. Today value was a

# ITM vs OTM options. Which ones should I be buying? by vtwop2  in options

I don't trade earnings, it's too much like playing Roulette.

# There are two types of traders by BannedForThe7thTime  in thetagang

One detail missing: the "max loss" on the theta side is the equity value of the resulting position,
which can be sold after it's increased. It's not a "flat out loss" like the WSB side.

# Be careful new investors by [deleted] in stocks

Guess what, I can pick two other dates along that timeline that suggest the exact opposite.

# ITM vs OTM options. Which ones should I be buying? by vtwop2  in options

It depends on many factors. I buy/sell options far/near ITM, ATM, OTM, all of them. In each case
it's because I want to stress some particular aspect of the position. Since options are
multi-variable, your distance from ATM is one of the ways you can exchange one of those variables
for another (for example, selling an ITM put increases max profit by increasing max risk, allowing
you to "dial in" exactly the balance you're aiming for).

# Is Bitcoin a legit way to gain money? by brizo420  in investing

He was running it from 2015 to late 2018, and while he claimed to be earning something, I was
indeed dubious. Maybe he was just willing to pay to own.

# Is Bitcoin a legit way to gain money? by brizo420  in investing

Thanks for asking.

The concept of a "blockchain" is a rather simple one, that has been used by computer engineers long
before cryptocurrency became popular. If you've ever heard of the Git version control system, every
"branch" is a blockchain -- which is to say, an immutable list due to the fact that each link in
the chain is bound by hash to the value of all its predecessors.

Certainly blockchains are great at maintaining a financial ledger, where you only grow the list of
transactions and they should never be modified, plus anyone else can verify the lack of
modification. But it's also a very restrictive data structure, which I believe is over-used in
industry right now due to the level of hype surrounding it (which makes it easier to get VC
funding, for example, just by using the word "blockchain"). There are other structures that are
very similar that aren't chains, like Merkle trees, and these are being used a lot too, but don't
get nearly the press, most of which is due to the level of profit people have made speculating on
Bitcoin.

At my particular company, we use blockchain for one thing: to ensure that all computers within a
distributed compute cluster receive the same list of inputs to work on. Since each compute unit is
deterministic, as long as we can guarantee commonality of inputs, we can rely on commonality of
results, which allows the whole machine to advance forward without needing intensive coordination
at each step. This is making it possible for us to build a "mega-computer" -- or something that
runs programs across thousands of machines while being both tamper-proof and resilient to presently
known forms of attack (including launching a missile at it).

And this is why you won't find blockchain mentioned in our literature, because it's just one aspect
of a much larger design. If, when you see "blockchain" you read "unmodified, grow-only list", then
the disparity between hype and reality should become much clearer.

# Hedging Gamma? by [deleted] in options

I've only just started gamma hedging myself, so can't offer any sage advice as to your questions,
but I do find it less stressful to hedge both at target levels of delta disparity, and at times of
day (like, closing every day at 0 delta, with usually one or two adjustments during the day if
there are large moves). Am currently doing this with NFLX, hedging a put debit spread by buying and
selling shares.

# Is Bitcoin a legit way to gain money? by brizo420  in investing

I'm not entirely sure what you mean by "contracting a brokerage", but yes, you can make money
running a mining rig -- whether your own, or one on the cloud. However, how much you can make (or
if you make any at all) depends on a lot of factors like cost of electricity and maintenance,
hashing power, etc. I have a friend who runs a rig with four graphics cards in his living room, but
a couple months ago he powered it off because the cost of power here in California become greater
than his find rate.

# I have $100 bucks to play with. What is an undervalued stock that I should invest in ASAP? by

# Is Bitcoin a legit way to gain money? by brizo420  in investing

I work in the blockchain space, but haven't ever invested in crypto. If some day there are
fundamentals behind it (like, the backing of a central bank or some link to infrastructure), I'd
consider it. Until then, it's better for people who enjoy trading purely off technicals and news.

# Earnings and inflation by [deleted] in stocks

What you've intuited is called "nominal growth" as opposed to real growth. And indeed, in times of

# Can you actually make a career in stocks? by gustavopluggedin  in stocks

I think finance can be incredibly interesting, as with most things, it really depends on how you
see it. When I saw math as "number recipes", it was incredibly boring; but after I learned to see
it as the symbolic language of abstraction, I couldn't get enough. The real trick is finding a good
teacher or mentor, who can help you see the beauty of the thing.

# Can you actually make a career in stocks? by gustavopluggedin  in stocks

You can study finance at college and become a trader, that's entirely possible. Making a living as
an independent retail trader... let's just say you'll want a backup plan ready to go. Maybe you're
one of the people who can make that work, but maybe you aren't.

# What is there to like about this market? by JP2205  in investing

It really depends on what/how you trade. My long-term trades are, I believe, well suited for growth
after a recession, so I don't worry too much about the next 3-5 years. For short-term trades, I
only look at the current month, which has been great for certain types of trades: a range-bound S&P
with gradual upward trend and a real possibility of sudden draw-down. This has been a good month
for selling covered calls at 30 delta on "green days", and closing them out for 50% on "red days".

If you wait for everything to be rosy and great before you enter the market, not only will you be
waiting a long time -- even during the huge bull run we had for a decade, the bears were constantly
clamoring -- you'll find yourself in a market where there are few deals to be had.

Trade what's in front of you.

# Can someone explain to me the different types of market orders like I was in 3rd grade? by
[deleted] in stocks

Something I wrote when I was trying to understand the same thing:

Order Types

MARKET

Buy/sell at whatever current "best price" the broker can fill for you. Usually fills very quickly,
but could be different from what you expected.

LIMIT

Buy/sell at a price better (i.e., in the trader's favor) than the given limit price. They may not
fill at all, or it may fill for only part of an order.

STOP

Buy/sell at any market price below the stop. In a sense this is a limit that may go against the
trader -- whereas a LIMIT is always in the trader's favor -- but it is guaranteed to happen.

STOPLIMIT

A stop-limit order combines a stop order with a limit order. With this order type, you enter two
price points: a stop price and a limit price. If the market value of the security reaches your stop
price (first price point), it automatically creates a limit order (second price point), as long as
it happens within the specified duration time. Example:

SELL TRAILSTOP at +0 ASK TRAIL -2% MARK

 1. Once the market is 2% below MARK at time of fill, a LIMIT sell order is entered at +0 the
    current ASK.

TRAILSTOP

Buy/sell at a given offset to the market price, where the buy/sell point is adjusted as the market
moves in the trader's favor. Example:

SELL TRAILSTOP at -3%
CURRENT = Current MARK price

 1. Once the market is 3% below CURRENT, a MARKET sell order is entered.
 2. If ever the market moves up, CURRENT moves up as well. Repeat.

TRAILSTOPLIMIT

A trailing-stop limit order is a type of order that triggers a limit order to buy or sell a
security once the market price reaches a specified dollar trailing amount that is below the peak
price for sells or above the lowest price for buys. Example:

SELL TRAILSTOPLIMIT at +0 ASK TRAIL -2% MARK
CURRENT = Current MARK price

 1. Once the market is 2% below CURRENT, a LIMIT sell order is entered at +0 the current ASK.

MOC

Buy/sell wherever the market is at close. Effectively becomes a MARKET order at end of trading day.

LOC

Buy/sell at the limit price (or better) at market close. Effectively becomes a LIMIT order at end
of trading day, which will fill only if the market price is in the submitter's favor.

# Is the market overvalued? I would like to hear people's opinions for and against this argument. by

Stocks trade against future earnings... a fair ways into the future. If prices aren't as depressed
as you think, it's because many investors are not expecting COVID-19 to be a major economic factor
by the end of next year. The real open question is how deep in the hole we can get before it takes
5-10 years to climb out (i.e., is this a return of the 1930s?). No one knows, but mainly it's the
virus that's standing in the way of a rebound, which explains why virus news, rather than earnings

# TIL Volatility Will Keep Decreasing Because Robots by gma617  in thetagang

Look up Market Gamma for a counterpoint to this idea. Yes, institutional investors squeeze

the opposite position is taken which actually magnifies volatility pretty significantly. If algo
traders could squeeze all of it out, it would imply they had removed most of the risk from the
market — but movements are not only dictated by internal actions.

# So, what's to stop people from buying a bunch of dividend stocks on margin on the ex date, holding

You generally see shares gap down the next morning by the amount of the dividend. But depending on
the market it may not take very long to return to that price; so maybe not "buy today, sell
tomorrow", but if you're willing to wait a bit, you could do it.

However, the longer you wait, the greater the risk, which is why this is not a free-lunch play.

rather sell to fear than buy on hype.

# Covered Calls or Cash Secured Puts? by SparkPlugJalapeno  in options

If you're ready to hit the buy button, sell an ATM put instead, unless you feel it is urgent to
enter the position. ATM puts are intended to have a 50/50 chance of assignment, which I find
generally works out over time (black swans excepted, of course). So why not collect premium and the
chance of winning that premium outright, if you're in no hurry to actually buy? Then, when you do
get put the shares, use covered calls to sell your way back out, or sell further OTM calls for a
better chance of retaining the position.

I wouldn't sell premium too far out, though. Your capital will be in a sort of limbo until
expiration (if you can't cash out early), and you can't (or shouldn't) sell calls against the
pending assigned shares. This is why I like weeklies for this method, although some like 30-45
days.

# Selling at a loss to repurchase later, does it make sense? by [deleted] in stocks

It didn't sound like you wanted to sell just to book a loss in the tax year, so I'm not sure why
people are warning you about a wash sale. If you buy at $30, sell at $20 and buy back at $10,
you'll still be lowering your cost basis by $10, even if the new cost basis is $20 ($10+($30-$20)).

The main risk is that it doesn't keep going down; but as with any trade, if you're willing to take
the risk and you're right, it can be an effective trade. I thought about selling UA on its way down
when it hit $12. Had I done so, I could have repurchased at $6. But I wasn't sure enough that it
would drop so far.

# Let's talk hedging. by akkan  in stocks

Yeah, I’d agree, as a separate speculation against surprise downside it makes sense, and gives some

positive and negative delta positions in uncertain times. I just wouldn’t think of it as much of a
hedge, since it won’t recover your capital in the case of another 50% correction. Maybe near half
of it, if the delta on the put moves to something like 0.7.

# Let's talk hedging. by akkan  in stocks

The difference in delta will mean you’re not getting much protection with that put. Say you buy 100
shares for $100 with a put at a strike of $60 (i.e., collared shares). There would have to be a
huge price drop and a massive spike in volatility for that put to recoup your losses on the shares.
At expiration, you’ll not have any protection at all for the first $40 of loss.

# Rolling Covered Calls Forever? by hello_internet1234  in options

If the stock keeps going up, your call will get deeper ITM and it will have less and less intrinsic
value, meaning when you roll there's not much premium involved.

Imagine a worst case scenario: Your call strike is $10 and the stock is currently $100. Your delta
is probably going to be 0.99. So to buy that call back you'll pay ~$90, but the $11 call for the
next week is going to be pretty close to ~$89, since it's delta may be 0.98. You end up outright
paying for the $1 raise in strike. Meanwhile, the stock could keep going up faster than $1/week,
meaning you'll never catch up and the situation just keeps getting worse.

TL;DR: It's not a linear problem, but a curve that steepens against you as the stock moves the
wrong way.

If so, I'm not sure CCCs are going to be the best scheme for producing elegant translations, since
by the very nature of the beast you lose any structure that doesn't matter (well, except to the

it.

# Selling put options by 89saint  in thetagang

I sell ITM puts if I really want to buy and I'm taking a strong bullish stance. Not too far ITM, so
that there's still intrinsic value, but deep enough that you earn more premium if the stock moves
in the direction you're expecting. If it doesn't, you buy the stock at a smaller discount than
selling an ATM put, but more flexibility. As with anything in options, it's about trade-offs. The
nice thing is that you can fine-tune the position to express your expectations in so many ways.

# Roll roll roll and the mindset of loses by staarkhand  in thetagang

There's been one thing that actually helps me when I'm "stuck" in a position: I stop trading it.
That is, if a short put goes against me and I enter an equity position at a loss, I'll leave that
position alone for a long time, maybe sell some calls against it, but otherwise wait for perhaps
months for it to come back.

To an expert trader, this is probably a terrible idea, because I've frozen up capital that could be
making more money than what I'll make when that stock finally turns around.

HOWEVER, I have no guarantee that doing "more trading" would translate into bigger gains. It could
also generate deeper losses. So from a psychological point of view, by taking that money off the
table for a while, it forces me to cool down and be a bit more cautious with the free capital that
I have left.

Sometimes waiting is a good strategy, if more activity would create bigger losses; but I agree that
sometimes it's also a terrible one, if there are other, better opportunities available. For me, I
use it as a mechanism to force risk aversion on myself when my DD hasn't been panning out.

# Strangles, the best way to play earnings? by potatofan1738  in options

Two other things to think about: if you blow through one side, rolling the winning side only gives
you as much as the premium sold there to absorb the shock. But the increase in loss can accelerate
much faster, if the underlying moves by, say, 20-30%.

Second, IV crush isn’t a guaranteed shock absorber. Earnings season takes place while other things
are also happening in the world, and those events can sometimes effect volatility more than the
earnings event.

In effect, you’re selling insurance to two people, and betting that the event will never be so bad
as to exceed the premium on both.

# Strangles, the best way to play earnings? by potatofan1738  in options

You’d need to be 6/6 on winning months, not trades, for me to buy this.

Short strangles carry enormous risk, and 6/6 just means you haven’t rolled the dice enough yet. 1
sigma in either direction means you should expect to lose on 32% of your trades.

# What do you do when you're mad at God? by tetracycle  in bahai

My favorite quote in this regard:

    O My servants! Sorrow not if, in these days and on this earthly plane, things contrary to your
    wishes have been ordained and manifested by God, for days of blissful joy, of heavenly delight,
    are assuredly in store for you. Worlds, holy and spiritually glorious, will be unveiled to your
    eyes. You are destined by Him, in this world and hereafter, to partake of their benefits, to
    share in their joys, and to obtain a portion of their sustaining grace. To each and every one
    of them you will, no doubt, attain.

Also consider that anger of this sort often arises from expectations: things we expected of life,
and of God, such that not being given them causes us anger and frustration — especially when those
who complain and take their lives for granted are seemingly given everything. It pays to dig deeper
into the root of such feelings, instead of stopping at the level of blame. If God is truly all
loving, there is more to this story.

# Learned the downside of covered calls this week.. by doctrader  in options

You can roll forward and up, if you think it will drop again. Or you can buy back and sell a put,
if you don’t mind the risk of increasing your equity. That way you get to keep profit on the shares
today, by transferring that loss into the short put. I’ve done this three times in the past week,
when my outlook switched from bearish to bullish on a covered call.

# Sold a tsla 980 C 5/01... help me please by pingnpong  in options

That’s definitely the safer route, and could protect you from some pin risk. Let your broker know
that if assigned, you want them to exercise the long to cover.

# Help fix option spread trade gone wrong by senorpickle3  in options

I would suggest going flat the day of expiration, assumed you aren’t assigned first. If that
happens, and you can’t afford to buy the shares at market price, your broker would likely exercise
the long call and you’d be out the strike width. If you don’t even have that much capital, I’m
surprised you haven’t already received a phone call and a warning of liquidation.

# Sold a tsla 980 C 5/01... help me please by pingnpong  in options

# When you were assigned early, how many DTE were left? by 3X-Leveraged  in thetagang

The former was exercised within a week of WORK's all-time low, so if they didn't want the shares
anymore that one makes sense. They could have cashed out the contract to conserve premium, but then
they'd be stuck with depressed shares. The latter was most likely a liquidation.

# Help fix option spread trade gone wrong by senorpickle3  in options

Buying a call below would just stop you from further loss, but you'll have to pay the premium in
addition to what you'd lose by just closing now. Another way to do it is to buy enough shares to
get delta neutral, if you think it might drop enough to gain back by selling. This doesn't get rid
of the loss, though, it just stops the bleeding. And it requires fairly active management, and
capital for the shares.

Aside from this, I'd recommend closing, or buying a higher strike call to define the loss. But be
ready to take that loss in full.

# Question about spreads and assignment by innocent-podestrian  in options

If you don't have the funds to purchase the shares on assignment, your broker (but really you
should ask them this question) ought to liquidate your covering put for you.

With TD, for example, you'd need option level 3 -- and thus, a margin account -- to trade such
credit spreads.

This should also indicate that if you're asking a question like this here, don't start with credit
spreads. Building intuition for how IV and time affect your position is a bit harder when you're
both long and short. Best to start with straight plays: cash-secured puts or long calls, to get a
feel for how they behave in various scenarios. When the mechanics of credit spreads start to make
complete sense, that's the time to start trading them.

In '08 we didn't have the same Fed we do now. Be sure you've also considered the odds of deflation

From https://etfdailynews.com/news/
6-ways-to-protect-your-assets-from-impending-deflation-including-etfs-dgz-xlu-vpu-vclt-tlt-d-pg-mo:

    Barclays 20+ Year Treasury Bond Fund (NYSE:TLT): Just like long bonds suffer when inflation
    kicks in due to a decrease in buying power, by locking in a current rate now with a future
    deflationary environment brewing, long bonds with yield are where you’ll want to be. While say,
    a 3.5% yield may not seem like much when you’re used to the context of 2-3% inflation, if
    you’re in a -3% deflationary environment, that’s a risk-free “real” 6.5% yield per year which
    is unheard of. Expect long duration Treasuries to rally and see yields drop if deflation kicks
    in. Short term bonds don’t have as much room to run as the yields are already at historic lows
    and the curve has some tilt to it. As the yield curve flattens out in expectation of a
    deflationary environment, those longer duration yields drop, driving the bond prices higher.

# What to do when every position is working against you? by Fr33Flow  in options

When I feel everything is going against me, it probably means my emotions are getting clouded, and
that I'm unconsciously becoming a bit vindictive toward the market, hoping to "win back" my losses.

At such times it's best to withdraw and take a month off. For your individual trades above, you'll
have to go with your gut and your own research, but once you're out, avoid opening new positions
until your head is back on straight.

The same is true on the flip side if I should start getting too cocksure or thinking I've "figured

Winning should confirm what you understand, and losses should inform future decisions. Much beyond
that, and you may be in for more surprises.

# Managing covered calls. Converting to inverted strangle by makotohadou2  in thetagang

I had a covered call this week that I was rolling up and out, but it just became too much in the
money. So I bought the call back and sold a put at the same cost. In a sense, I'm shifting the loss
from the short call into the cost basis of the shares-to-be-assigned on the put. It's a transition
from bearish to bullish, as now my loss is diminished by further moves upward, rather than
increased. But at expiry I'd rather have more shares with a higher cost basis, than take the loss
directly with the call.

Of course, it's only in my mind that these two things are connected. After buying back the call, I
could have sought other ways to recover the loss.

# Is this a valid approach?? by NeverNotDope  in options

It's useful to track your gains and losses.

Here's another thing you can do:

 1. At the start of each month or year, note the total dollar value of your cash account. Consider
    these as "shares" with a value of $1.00 each.

 2. Each time you book a gain or loss, multiply the number of your "shares" by their current price
    (starting at $1.00), add the gain or subtract the loss, and divide by the number of shares.
    This reprices your "shares". For example, if you had 10,000 @ $1.00 and booked a gain of
    $1,000, then you'd have 10,000 @ $1.10.

 3. Each time you add or withdraw money to/from the account, divide it by the current value of your
    shares and add/subtract that amount to/from the shares. So if you withdrew $1,000 in the
    example above, you'd reduce the number of shares by 909.09 ($1,000 / $1.10).

With these records, the "dollar value" of your shares minus $1.00 will equal your ROI over the time
period that you do the tracking. In the example above, 10%. Subtract from this your index of choice
to determine your alpha, or how much you've out or under-performed the market.

This can be of course be automated using a spreadsheet, as long as you enter your gains and loss,
and deposits and withdrawals. I've gone ahead and created such a spreadsheet for you here:

http://ftp.newartisans.com/pub/ROI.xlsx

Just one number per line into gain, loss, deposit or withdrawal, and it will keep a running tally
of your ROI. You could use sub-totals to track the same numbers you mentioned above as well.

Exactly. You bought insurance from someone willing to take on risk. Then you transferred that

# Selling naked calls by Give_me_an_M3  in options

The original seller might have the shares. Or maybe they transferred their risk by purchase of an
identical contract to someone else willing to write it; and if THAT person doesn’t have the shares,
they may have to pay to buy the shares at market price on the day of expiration, no matter how
high. Theoretically unlimited.

Always have the shares if selling a call, or buy a higher strike call as insurance to form a
spread. Selling naked calls is like shorting stock with less profit potential.

If they did, the assignment would affect the person who sold the contract to you — unless they in
turn had transferred their obligation to someone else as well.

Think of a contract as between two parties. At any time either of the parties can trade places with
someone else, but every moment in time there is still a contract and always two parties bound by
it. The person who first creates the contract “writes” it, and it lives until either expiration,
exercise, or until you become the holder of both sides.

# Delta Hedging with Synthetic Stock Positions by [deleted] in options

Although, note that I'm not saying options aren't good for hedging. They can also be used to cancel
out vega/theta/gamma effects. I'm just questioning whether your synthetic scenario is a full enough
picture, based on what you want to accomplish.

# Critique My Strategy by zookeepier  in options

Those aren't the odds of winning; those are the market's prediction today of the odds of winning.
If anyone could invest with a 90% guaranteed win rate, this would be a very different game.

# Delta Hedging with Synthetic Stock Positions by [deleted] in options

If you find that, come back and let me know.

# Delta Hedging with Synthetic Stock Positions by [deleted] in options

One reason that shares are good for delta hedging is that they have a fixed delta that doesn't
change as the underlying moves. If you hedge for delta with options, you'll have to take into
account the gamma on your hedge as well as the delta you accomplish at the time of sale/purchase.

# Critique My Strategy by zookeepier  in options

Don't trade for 1:10 odds against yourself. That means you need a better than 90% win rate just to

# Best stocks to trade the wheel on? by Garrett_OL  in options

Add some companies you like to a watch list, then pay attention to them and how the news affects
them over an extended period, until you start to get some sense of how they “behave”. This will
give you a better idea of decent entry and exit points over time. You need to understand the stock
at least a bit to be predictable with the wheel.

For example, BAC has been a good wheel stock for me, but NFLX absolutely has not. I haven’t lost
money on it, I just ended up getting “stalled” with NFLX often, while BAC had more of a steady
rhythm.

But also know that things have a season, and what works well during one period may stop working
later.

If you buy to close before expiration, you might have more money than you started with. At

than it's worth at expiration. Hence, P/L.

# Why does eshell choke on long output commands? by OscilloLlama  in emacs

# Are selling puts a viable option for possibly taking a long position that I am bullish in, but
don't want to pay market price...rather than low limit orders? by cchsbball23  in options

It’s my favorite strategy in fact. Just beware that when a black swan hits — and this happened to
me in March — you’ll end up getting assigned on every one of your puts, buying stock for 50% or
more than what it’s currently trading at. It’s no fun being obligated to buy BA for $300 when it
trades at $90.

So you just have to plan for this. Now I have equity that I keep selling calls against, and intend
to hold on to for a long time. That’s why it’s essential to pick companies you’re ready to buy and
hold. Options are a way of directly trading the unpredictability of the market, so every once in a
while it’s going to strike you like a viper.

# How do I resign? by Divan001  in bahai

A covenant breaker can only be named as such by the Universal House of Justice, and only if the
individual has demonstrated a pattern of actively seeking to undermine the authority of the House,
Shoghi Effendi, or ‘Abdu’l-Bahá (i.e., the line of succession from Bahá’u’lláh). Doing so could
lead to deep schisms in the community, and so we do not tolerate such behavior, choosing instead to
entirely dissociate with such individuals. There are covenant breakers active today on the Web, but
Bahá’ís do not (or should not) interact with them.

The argument used against this position is that we are denying a full investigation of the truth,
or maybe they have some basis for their claims, etc. But it is the position of Bahá’í law that
unity is paramount, to the extent that if any two should argue about religious truth, both are
wrong simply by that fact.

# Stocks vs Leaps on calls by beats_working_  in options

What do you do if you’re assigned on the short side? Hope you can buy back in under the strike?

# Stocks vs Leaps on calls by beats_working_  in options

A LEAP gives you plenty of time and good leverage, but the trade-off is low delta unless you're
deep ITM. And it pays no dividends, though it does reduce total risk.

But you can easily control 10x the shares using a LEAP for the same or less capital, to offset the
delta, as long as you don't make a terrible mistake in timing.

I use LEAPs myself maybe 10% of the time, but generally prefer equity so that I can sell calls and
not worry about theta.

# Will there always be profit if the stock hits the strike price of my option? by [deleted] in

If holding to expiration, you need the stock to move beyond your strike, in the amount of the
premium paid, to reach break even (no loss, no profit). Anything beyond that is where your profits
come from.

If closing prior to expiration, a few factors could bring you a profit, such as a surge in IV, even
if your stock is above the strike by a bit.

# Higher max return than risk on Credit Spreads? by rpe23  in options

The loss is greater than the profit, but consider this:

    loss, after all.
    profit from the long.
    can know that?

Best case scenario: A market dive followed by a strong recovery above 2510 sometime before the
month is out, such that you profit nicely on both sides.

Nominal scenario: A market decline that persists.

Emotionally unkind, but still good: Market has a short bull run, but turns negative and stays
there.

Worst case: A recovery through the month.

If you stay on top of the position, you should be OK. Likely your best chance for profit will be
closing early, first the short and then the long. Volatility should help with that, since we
haven't held consistent in any one direction lately.

Meanwhile, why not buy a put with the same delta? You'd be paying up front, though depending on
similar (market goes down) yet simpler (you only want down) market conditions, with a bigger profit
potential. Are you using the credit spread because you want the payout in advance?

# Vertical Put Spreads by heinzmoleman  in options

A put debit spread (bearish) caps gains to reduce the cost of buying the put outright. A put credit

articles/active-trading/032614/which-vertical-option-spread-should-you-use.asp

Where premium is the cost of the long minus the sale of the short.

Great planning. If you further limit any one investment to risking at most 2% capital, it should be

Unless you have good reason to think they will drop much further, now is the worst time to sell.
Fear of loss is a horrible reason to act, if you can afford to be patient and weather the storm.
I’d advise not looking at those positions anymore; write them off in your mind as a total loss
already, and check back a year from now. Call it the bushido method. Very likely at least one of
them will surprise you enough to help offset the rest.

Stop investing just to make money, it’s a terrible motivator. Instead, invest to put your knowledge
to work, test the mettle of your judgement, and create opportunities to learn more about finance,
economics and how investments work.

Align your emotions with your plan, not the market. So I say: don’t double down, don’t sell
prematurely. Stay the course, and let your mistakes cultivate understanding.

I sell puts on companies that I feel are getting down to bargain range. I like AAPL, DIS, TGT, BAC,

but overall volatility has meant that almost every market condition (up, down, flat) returns within
the week. Calls that were seriously against me last Friday, that I was about to roll, ended up
closing at target profits today. It’s a wild ride, which means the most essential thing is to keep
to your strategy. I refuse to close anything at a loss, as so far patience has rewarded every time.

Why is that a steal? ThinkOrSwim tells me the market predicts a +/- move of 9.3 points by that date

# Selling low strike price puts with very short expiry? by [deleted] in options

100 contracts would require sufficient margin to cover a $260,000 purchase right now, because worst

That’s a maximize possible profit of $5,500 (.55 * 100 * 100) by putting $260,000 at risk. Sure you
could sell the SPY shares at a profit sometime later, but you don’t know how long you’d end up
stuck in the position.

you’re taking on to make that profit.

# Market manipulation by kiranksethi  in options

The Fed’s job is to manipulate the economy toward a consistent 2% inflation rate, and its actions
will definitely affect the market as it does so. Look at how the stock market has responded to rate
cuts and increases, and balance sheet adjustments.

I think your question is whether there are people who are engineering these changes for their own
personal gain while others lose. Because it’s fully intended to manipulate things for the benefit
of the US overall.

When China did the same thing recently, the President openly accused them in the press of being
currency manipulators. Here the problem isn’t that they’re affecting interest rates — which all
central banks do all the time — but that it was feared they were doing it in a manner worthy of a
mitigating response.

# Selling options? by slampig3  in options

My current goal is around 1% realized income per month. I assess trades in terms of maximum risk
more than other factors. For example, putting 0.1% capital at risk of total loss is something I
avoid unless multiple indicators are favorable; while I’m comfortable putting 0.5% at risk if the
worst case is unfavorably entering an equity position that I believe has strong future potential.
So, selling premium against Bank of America is much preferred over buying SPY puts.

# TLT and other bonds by inhumanforms  in options

Think of a bond’s interest rate as an incentive. It goes up when the bond is cheap to entice people
to buy; it goes down when the bond is pricey because the incentive isn’t needed as much.

Treasury bonds are the savings account of the market: it’s where you park loads of cash because
they’re secured by the US government. In times of crisis or risk aversion, generally bonds (and
TLT) will go up, because demand is high from all the money moving into them.

However, recent dilution of the dollar has caused cash equivalent assets (like bonds) to become a
bit less attractive, because although such money is safe, it’s deteriorating in value. So things
fluctuate between the need for safety and the need for return.

# Selling options? by slampig3  in options

I’ve been selling options regularly (5-30 trades a week) for nine months now. On PUTs I’ve lost
money only once, because I made a hugely wrong bet during an earnings week. I consider it a
valuable education well paid for. I do get assigned shares ~30% of the time, and sell later at a
profit. The real question is how long you have to wait, and whether the money could have done
better elsewhere. Pure profit is not the only measure.

I also sell a lot of covered calls, and sure, I lose out on upside from time to time. It makes for
a nice income generator over an equity position that isn’t doing much otherwise.

I have monthly goals that I benchmark my trading against. I’m not looking for large profits when
selling premium, but consistency (and relative safety) of income. Doing it frequently over solid,
value-based underlyings is the key. Stick to around .3 to .2 delta on the sell side. Use limit sell
orders and be patient.

If you are holding a contract, you don’t need anything else to sell it.

return if delta is not very high (that is, the loss of time value is offset by the higher delta of
shares being sold).

# Greeks questions by submittomemeow2 in options

I recommend the CBOE Online Options Course (http://www.cboe.com/education/education-main). Not only
will it clarify most of your questions, but it gives you exercises and tests that you can repeat

Delta increases as strike moves further ITM while Gamma decreases away from ATM. Vega increases
with more days to expiration while Theta decreases with more DTE.

Your example might be clearer if you just played with one variable at a time, rather than looking
at contracts all over the board.

Volatility dropped Friday, and your contracts were almost all premium. IV could well be different

Downside is if you cover just when volatility drops and your stock begins a steady upward climb

The deeper you go, the less premium you get over and above the price difference, until you’re

I prefer to sell close to the money, thinking similar thoughts. You want to maximize the effect of
theta to offset the price move.

Note: the reason this works out over time is because the market tends to over-predict downward
moves (by about 5% according to Option Alpha’s analysis). But you have to do it often for it to be
a net winning strategy.

# Can we talk about IV over 100% ? by stilloriginal in options

    Implied volatility is expressed as a percentage of the stock price, indicating a one standard

Thus, an IV of 250% implies a 68% chance of a 2.5x move in price within the year. If the curve over
that year were flat — though there is no reason to assume that — then 1.25x in six months.

It doesn’t just have to go up in six months. For you to profit well, it has to go up higher than
the rest of the market is also expecting. OR, it needs to go up suddenly, sharper than expected,
and you sell the contract on the bump.

# Options Trading by [deleted] in thinkorswim

If you trade a lot, you can ask to reduce fees to $0.50. Beware that index options have a fixed fee
of $0.65 on the exchange side, and if your TD fee becomes less than that, you’ll have to pay both.
For example, when trading VIX options.

# Options - buying or selling? by G_E_N_I_U_S in options

True, true, there is a lot of hurt on the rocky road to infinite. There’s a reason I’ve never sold
a naked call.

# Question re: using options to hedge by [deleted] in options

You might want to lock in profits without selling because of tax concerns, effectively putting a
“hold” on an equity position until the down period — like now — blows over. Note that gamma will
require you to frequently adjust to maintain the hedge.

# Options - buying or selling? by G_E_N_I_U_S in options

But it’s very much a theoretical infinite. On the short put side, you end up with expensive stock.
On the short call side, you have to buy and then sell at a loss. The odds of a stock going to zero
or infinity (the max loss scenarios) in after-market the day before assignment — how many times has
that happened?

# Is there a place i can find option price charts by [deleted] in options

In the TOS app go to charts, and enter the option symbol. This will give you a price chart for the
option against its theoretical price.

Easiest way to get the option symbol is to right-click in your watchlist and Copy the symbol’s
name. It will begin with a period and contain several letters and numbers.

Note too that if you do this in the Active Trader, you can buy/sell contracts with single clicks,
just like with equities.

# GLD 2022 leaps are up 70% this week while GLD is flat by hangingbacon in options

There can be a put/call skew, if the market has a stronger feeling that the stock will go one way
or the other.

IV is an interesting topic, and something every options trader should know in considerable detail.
I was going to write a whole bunch here about it, and how things changed in 1987, but figured it
would be better to just link you to a quality introduction to start from: https://

Do you also keep an eye on the futures market, or what’s happening with the central banks and
treasuries?

# Deep ITM Put? by bobbythebich in options

The same with PUTs, but not any more or less 1:1. This is exactly what the delta represents, this
ratio.

However, there is also gamma, by which the delta of your long put position improves as the
underlying drops further, or if time passes and the stock remains flat or drops. It will never be
truly 1:1, however, only asymptotically close as the stock drops to $0 or when expiration arrives.

# Deep ITM Put? by bobbythebich in options

Right, the deeper in the money you go, the less time value you’re paying for, as you begin
approximating an equity stake in the position (delta of 1 or -1). At that point, you’re buying
leverage and risk limits in exchange for the possibility of a total loss of premium.

For example, I use deep in the money LEAP calls sometimes when I feel sure about a stock, but want
to use the leverage to keep some capital free for other plays.

# Modest gains by [deleted] in options

Thanks for sharing, but such posts don’t educate us or offer any new insight or ideas. I’d love to

# GLD 2022 leaps are up 70% this week while GLD is flat by hangingbacon in options

IV is implied volatility. It defines what volatility would have to be to justify what people are
willing to pay for options today.

A surge in future GLD contracts means that many people, or one person buying many contracts, have
reason to believe gold will alter course in the future. The recent backwardation in the gold
futures market is another indicator this may happen.

So, IV doesn’t drive prices, rather it’s a reading of the market’s actual activity. Which, of
course, affects prices when it changes what people do who pay attention to IV. :)

# Is my understanding of theta and Vega correct? by wavyleafplant in options

You too, options friend. Best of luck in these volatile days. Keep safe.

# Is my understanding of theta and Vega correct? by wavyleafplant in options

I’m still seeking a good book on the more advanced topics. For now, it’s just Internet education,
and working out the implications of same as I observe the market and my trades.

# Deep ITM Put? by bobbythebich in options

Correct, being long a put is a bearish position, like shorting the stock, but with fixed risk. The
delta won’t be the same until expiration, and only if you’re in the money then.

# Is my understanding of theta and Vega correct? by wavyleafplant in options

Thanks for mentioning that, Vomma was probably more relevant to my point, since Vanna is a
derivative of both Vega and Delta.

# UUP at .01 by Sinclister in options

Was that price LAST, MARK, BID or ASK? For example, Mark shows the mid between bid and ask. It
doesn’t mean any contracts have yet sold at that price. Last relates to an actual sale, but doesn’t
mean it would happen again. Liquidity is what makes these numbers useful.

# 2022 Spy Calls by bRownies21 in options

Well, it’s not all about price. As stability returns and we begin trending positive again, IV will
drop fast compared to today’s levels. Check the break-even price that SPY call would have to be at
for you to profit at expiration. The options market has already priced in how far they think SPY
will move in two years. You’d be betting it goes beyond that.

# Volatility Plays by growthPlz in options

VIX isn’t a red/green indicator. It’s the width of the swings, which were a bit more muted today.

# someone bought my faux Gucci today by [deleted] in options

Probably someone expecting and end of day pop during the triple witching hour...

# Is my understanding of theta and Vega correct? by wavyleafplant in options

Pretty close, except that Vanna will indicate the change in Vega with each percentage point of IV
move.

Assuming no effect from Vanna, your option value change with assumed +3% IV should be: +.16 * 3 -
.52, or -0.04.

# Cash Secured Puts by SkinnyShin in options

I use a lot of CSPs and covered calls (even if expiration would create a loss). As expiration
nears, and I think things will keep trending against me, I roll forward and up (or down) as needed.
I close whenever the wave surges in the other direction, and usually re-open when it returns.
Mostly 7 and 30 day expirations.

Haven’t been assigned yet, but several of my positions keep wavering in and out of the money.
Interested to see what happens next week.

# Theta on ThinkOrSwim by OwnStocksMunchBox in options

Options are not “marked to market”. You only lose money as you sell or expire. Now, if all else
remains the same but the passage of time, then yes, theta is stealing your bacon, but you get to
hold onto it until expiration.

# Stop buying options with low volume/open interest. by AnotherSidedInquirer in options

It paints lines at 25% to expiration, 50, 75, 100. Then you can see how the Greeks are being
affected at a glance.

You can click on Lines and choose +4 @ Expiration. My guess is that being two months out, the two
options are canceling out the weak theta decay.

# Put question by rainyseattle162 in options

You could also roll forward and down a little bit, extend the bet. That is, buy it back tomorrow at
a loss, sell another contract at the same cost, which will usually be a little lower.

# Question about unusual options activity (does it actually matter)? by NoParlayNoFood in options

A lot of contracts changed hands, but the numbers don’t tell us how much of that activity was

you use those proceeds to immediately re-enter at a lower strike, or invest elsewhere?

# DIS $90 4/17 put hold? by KommandantVideo in options

Maybe sell, wait for DIS to move up again, buy it back. Things have been fluctuating a lot lately,

# Question about options being exercised by prisma1224 in options

Your broker will tell you you’re being exercised. You won’t be able to change that fact.

# beginner question about selling a put by typicalsweg in options

Btw, the bid isn’t what you have to sell your contract for, that’s just what someone is willing to
pay. I always use limit orders to sell at the ask and buy at the bid, and wait on market
fluctuations to close the order. Sure, I fail to close within the day about 20% of the time, but
often am not in a major hurry.

Just want to clarify that time is flexibility in these matters. I rolled a contract for a credit
the other day that “should” have been a debit, but it seems someone was desperate enough to bite,
and I was willing to wait for them to do so.

# Options premium by repsonreps1 in options

A premium is the market's expectation realized as a dollar amount. Therefore, it is neither cheap
nor expensive. It is the monetary form of risk, quite literally.

# SPY calls by justin23sh in options

Hey there, that sounds like quite a long shot bet. I'd make it a LEAP at the very least, and learn
about rolling to adjust the expiration as market conditions evolve.

Then ask yourself: could that money serve you better elsewhere? It may do nothing for a long time
in that call, if we head into a global recession. SPY could be <$200 for a while.

# My trades executed at the wrong price on TD Ameritrade by [deleted] in options

A market order is you offering to pay the spread to the broker in order to enter or exit the
position as soon as possible. I don’t think I’ve placed a market order in several months. Limits
are what you want.

# Help me understand strikes relative to a stocks price by [deleted] in options

In the case of a put, the break even is the strike minus premium collected. Any price above this at
expiration will result in a profit.

Before expiration, several things could make the trade profitable, such as an increase in
volatility, so things are a little more complex prior to expiration.

# Where are the mods? by Realdeal43 in options

# Pedal down or play it safe? Up a metric buttload by thisrich in options

This month was a ridiculously well-timed moment to be long SPY puts, because premiums were low end
of Feb and then all hell broke loose as market gamma went crazy.

It’s a different environment now, and you shouldn’t necessarily expect the same play to work again.
It’ll take a much larger drop, or another boost to IV (read: catastrophe) to replicate your earlier
performance in a similar position.

I’d use your 48k to collateralize some short puts against GLD, for example, and focus on retaining
capital until premiums make it a better time to buy again.

# Is it true that majority of options traders lose more money than they make over time? by LiL_penut
in options

You’d be forced to buy from them. But you were about to buy any way, so....

I rarely buy equities outright anymore, unless I’m trying to catch a dip.

# Realistic to swing trade options? by agrenet in options

I like to swing trade on the short side, selling calls and puts and often closing the same day due
to these intraday swings. When IV drops again it should help any open positions; I roll weeklies
forward and up/down when things turn against me, because it doesn’t take long lately for things to
turn back.

It’s a very different market from two months ago. Premiums are intense, meaning it only takes a 20%
return on a trade to net the same as a 75% return before (i.e., aiming to keep that much of the
premium before closing).
