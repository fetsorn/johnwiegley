    One night, having reached
    the ocean of mystery
    I dipped my simple cup

    Yea, it was wet
    it slaked my thirst
    it tasted of the sea
    it filled me up...

    But there was no royal blue
    nor leviathans of the deep
    no pearls of great luster
    nor place for whales to sleep

    To know these, I could not bring
    the sea to me in my familiar cup

    Rather must I to dive
    out far beyond the shore
    and, losing sight of land,
    learn the language of the fishes
    in silence her mysteries to keep
